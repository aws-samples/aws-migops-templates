# Module: Contact Center MRA
## Task 1: MRA - Review objectives and best practices
#### Description
Migration Readiness Assessment is a critical step early in the migration Journey to assess readiness of  customers' applications for migrating to AWS. Customers gain critical insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the identified gaps.
 
The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand their adoption into AWS.

As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives migh include building an overall vision; creating a reliable implementation roadmap; identifying gaps; and providing corrective actions, etc. 

MRA also includes reviewing the current architecture, security, and governance, and preparing for cloud adoption by creating concrete deliverables. By validating migration readiness against the available best practices, customers can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture and avoid possible roadblocks while migrating.

For more information about MRA, see [Migration Readiness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-readiness/welcome.html.)

## Task 5: Conduct roles and responsibility workshop
#### Description
Contact-center leadership, culture, and change perspective are critical to establishing an organization’s cloud fluency and readiness to perform an enterprise-wide contact center transformation effort.
As determined in contact center discovery, preparing for contact center transformation requires the organization to have people with relevant AWS expertise, established operational processes, and a leadership team dedicated to mobilizing the appropriate resources.  Leading teams through the many organizational and transformational challenges presented over the course of a large-scale change effort is essential.  

Based on many years of experience leading and advising enterprises across a wide array of industries, AWS has found that organizational adoption of change and political and cultural impact are the most challenging and underestimated roadblocks to cloud adoption success.  

We have developed this workstream with a focus on understanding the contact-center resource composition and a deep dive on roles and responsibilities as an accelerator to resource transformation.

All details on objectives, key milestones, and risks that this workshop will mitigate are available in [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/AmazonConnect-Migration/v1.0/Amazon-Connect).
