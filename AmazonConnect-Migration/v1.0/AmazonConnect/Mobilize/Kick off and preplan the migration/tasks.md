# Module: Kick off and preplan the migration
## Task 1: Review previous contact center assessment activity
#### Description
Review details from CCMRA, check the latest CCMRA report from the corresponding task in the Assess phase, and ensure the relevant stakeholders have access. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Ensure that the CCMRA report has been thoroughly discussed and vetted. All potential risks will be addressed in future tasks. 
## Task 2: Review discovery read out
#### Description

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Completed review discovery read out.
## Task 3: If deeper assessment is needed, plan for further discovery
#### Description
If further discovery is required, use the contact center CCMRA template to fill details and create a deeper discovery portfolio to plan for migration. Discuss with the relevant stakeholders and add all data in one place to look at the risk posture. Having these details in a single place will help with the migration. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Decide if a deeper discovery of the existing contact center is required. If it is, generate an CCMRA report using the contact center MRA template.

5.	High availability with Amazon Connect
6.	Reporting training
## Task 4: Subtask 1: Discovery workshop
#### Description
Relevant stakeholders meet with AWS to review and capture the following:  

•	Customer history, past POCs, AWS and Amazon Connect maturity.

## Task 5: Conduct roles and responsibility workshop
#### Description
Contact-center leadership, culture, and change perspective are critical to establishing an organization’s cloud fluency and readiness to perform an enterprise-wide contact center transformation effort.
As determined in contact center discovery, preparing for contact center transformation requires the organization to have people with relevant AWS expertise, established operational processes, and a leadership team dedicated to mobilizing the appropriate resources.  Leading teams through the many organizational and transformational challenges presented over the course of a large-scale change effort is essential.  

Based on many years of experience leading and advising enterprises across a wide array of industries, AWS has found that organizational adoption of change and political and cultural impact are the most challenging and underestimated roadblocks to cloud adoption success.  

We have developed this workstream with a focus on understanding the contact-center resource composition and a deep dive on roles and responsibilities as an accelerator to resource transformation.

All details on objectives, key milestones, and risks that this workshop will mitigate are available in [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/AmazonConnect-Migration/v1.0/Amazon-Connect).
