# Module: Populate backlogs
## Task 1: Create engagement and execution plan
#### Description
Prepare a presentation using the Microsoft PowerPoint template in [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/AmazonConnect-Migration/v1.0/Amazon-Connect). Meet with work stream leads, spend time reviewing next steps, and assign appropriate owners. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure that the work stream leads acknowledge the plan and that they start putting together backlogs for their areas in the next set of tasks. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog
## Task 2: Create task roadmap
#### Description
Use the task roadmap template in GitHub and create relevant tasks for work-stream owners to create their respective backlog. The template in [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/AmazonConnect-Migration/v1.0/Amazon-Connect) covers multiple work streams. Add additional work streams as needed. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure that tasks per work stream are created in this phase. Ensure that all tasks have owners assigned by the work-stream lead. 
## Task 3: Create subtasks roadmap
#### Description
Use the subtasks roadmap template in GitHub and create a subtask for each work-stream owner to create their respective backlog. The template in [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/AmazonConnect-Migration/v1.0/Amazon-Connect) covers multiple work streams. Add additional work streams as needed. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure that subtasks per task are created in this phase. Ensure that all tasks have owners assigned by the work-stream lead. 
## Task 4: Plan sprints and perform tasks and subtasks
#### Description
Ensure that each task and subtask is planned to be performed in a future sprint. All task assignees must update the start date and end date for each task based on planning. When tasks are completed, work-stream owners can choose to double-check the acceptance criteria for each task and confirm completion. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure that the timelines for performing tasks and subtasks are recorded. Ensure that all work-stream leads keep up with the timelines and discuss risks.  
• Assign due dates to all tasks and subtasks according to the sprint plan.
