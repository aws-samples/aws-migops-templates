# Module: Contact Center MRA
## Task 1: MRA - Review objectives and best practices
#### Description
Migration Readiness Assessment is a critical step early in the migration Journey to assess readiness of  customers' applications for migrating to AWS. Customers gain critical insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the identified gaps.
 
The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand their adoption into AWS.

As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives migh include building an overall vision; creating a reliable implementation roadmap; identifying gaps; and providing corrective actions, etc. 

MRA also includes reviewing the current architecture, security, and governance, and preparing for cloud adoption by creating concrete deliverables. By validating migration readiness against the available best practices, customers can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture and avoid possible roadblocks while migrating.
