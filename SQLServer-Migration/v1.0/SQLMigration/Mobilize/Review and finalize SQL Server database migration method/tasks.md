# Module: Review and finalize SQL Server database migration method
## Task 1: Review AWS Prescriptive Guidance on SQL Server Migration Strategy
#### Description
At a high level, there are two options for migrating a SQL Server database from on premises to the AWS Cloud: either stay on SQL Server (homogeneous migration) or move off SQL Server (heterogeneous migration). In a homogeneous migration, you don’t change the database engine. That is, your target database is also a SQL Server database. In a heterogeneous migration, you switch your SQL Server databases either to an open-source database engine such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB, or to an AWS Cloud-native database such as Amazon Aurora.

Check APG [SQL Server migration methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-sql-server/methods.html) for more information.
