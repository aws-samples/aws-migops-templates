# Module: Application optimization and Modernization
## Task 1: Assess  scope of application optimization or modernization
#### Description
The first step in a modernization journey is to analyze the existing application portfolio, carefully assess systems that need to be modernized, and build and carry out a technical solution for application modernization by using the right strategy 
1) Assess applications through five lenses:
a) Strategic or business fit
b) Functional adequacy
c) Technical adequacy
d) Financial fit
e) Digital readiness 
2) Group, rank, and sequence applications 
3) Document target and interim operating models 
4) Understand key technology and regulatory requirements
5) Determine applications that need extensive data migration  
6) Clarify the scope and volume of the data to be converted For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/assess.html)
#### Tools
Application modernization questionnaire
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document the technical and functional tools required to achieve  optimization
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document a  detailed optimization strategy or blueprint 
## Task 2: Execute application optimization or modernization plan
#### Description
During  this phase, determine project goals and resource requirements, and build out  the implementation roadmap. The goal is to revitalize applications by using a  modernization program that creates a modern, agile application  architecture  
1) Determine the milestones for converting your applications’ source code  and data  
2) Complete the mapping of all operational areas to ensure that required  standards and procedures for operating  
3) Implement an infrastructure solution that can address all concerns in  the existing environmentFor more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/modernize.html)



#### Tools
AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document modernization readiness to check if the current environment can be  modernized
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Monitor key business metrics to help progress towards modernization
## Task 3: Track results from optimization or modernization exercise
#### Description
Embracing  a new DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering capabilities is essential to successful modernization adoption.For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/manage.html.)
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Implement optimizations using an iterative approach to make the  environment efficient
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document constant improvements and betterments needed to optimize the  existing environment
## Task 4: Use AWS compute optimizer to optimize migrated workloads
#### Description
AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides graphs showing recent utilization metric history data, as well as projected utilization for recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis and visualization of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements.

## Task 5: Use AWS License Manager to manage BYOL licenses
#### Description
If you are responsible for managing licenses in your organization, you can use License Manager to set up licensing rules, attach them to your launches, and keep track of usage.
#### Tools
AWS License Manager
