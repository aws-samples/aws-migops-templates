## Task 2: Discovering and evaluating databases for migration with AWS DMS Fleet Advisor
#### Description
You can use DMS Fleet Advisor to collect metadata and performance metrics from multiple database environments. These collected metrics provide insight into your data infrastructure. DMS Fleet Advisor collects metadata and metrics from your on-premises database and analytic servers from one or more central locations without the need to install it on every computer. 

For databases in your inventory that you plan to migrate to the AWS Cloud, DMS Fleet Advisor generates right-sized target recommendations. To generate target recommendations, DMS Fleet Advisor considers the metrics from your data collector and preferred settings. After DMS Fleet Advisor generates recommendations, you can view detailed information for each target database configuration. Your organization's database engineers and administrators can use DMS Fleet Advisor Target Recommendations to plan the migration of their on-premises databases to AWS. Also, you can explore different available migration options and export these recommendations. Finally, you can use the AWS Pricing Calculator to further optimize the cost.
