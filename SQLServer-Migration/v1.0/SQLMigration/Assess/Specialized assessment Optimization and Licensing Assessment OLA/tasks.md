# Module: Specialized assessment Optimization and Licensing Assessment OLA
## Task 1: Arrange a session to introduce Optimization and Licensing Assessment
#### Description
When planning an executive strategy for cloud adoption and infrastructure modernization, customers can feel lost when looking for a starting point. Which workload should they move to the cloud first? How do they ensure they're choosing the right services? What do they do with their existing Microsoft software licenses? Can they bring them along, or is it smarter to rent them leveraging our pay-as-you go (license included) model and break free from the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement? 

In this session, customers get to know to the OLA process, tools and benefits of running OLA assessment. This will help to identify a migration strategy that meets their TCO and ROI requirements as well as moving faster towards their digital transformation strategy.
