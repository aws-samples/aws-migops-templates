# Module: Develop a prioritization order for migration
## Task 1: Prioritize application migration order
#### Description
Application prioritization is the process of determining the order in which applications must be migrated to the cloud. Assess priority based on the complexity of migrating the application to the cloud and the rules that are defined.For more information, see [Large Migration Portfolio playbook prioritization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html)

#### Acceptance Criteria
• A list of application components prioritized based on the business and technical rules.
## Task 1: Subtask 1: Define the  application prioritization process
#### Description
There are three process options for prioritizing applications:

1) Manual complexity scoring: Use complexity scoring criteria to assess the difficulty of migrating each application
2) Application nomination: Application owners nominate applications for migration
3) Discovery tool: Define criteria within the parameters of the discovery tool, and then the tool analyzes the applications and provides a final  complexity score.For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html#prioritization-1)

#### Acceptance Criteria
•  Prioritization process based on discovery tools
## Task 1: Subtask 2: Define the application prioritization rules
#### Description
Define application prioritization rules, to determine the migration order of the applications. 

Create rules to assess the priority of each application so you can schedule the application in the appropriate wave. 

Common business and technology rules include the following:  
1) Specifying the order and schedule for migrating data centers  
2) Prioritizing business units  
3) Capturing deadlines for critical business applicationsFor more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html#prioritization-2)
#### Tools
Portfolio playbook templates
#### Acceptance Criteria
•  Defined prioritization rules
## Task 1: Subtask 3: Finalize the application prioritization process
#### Description
Define how the  portfolio workstream uses the rules and processes to prioritize applications.  This is the process that the portfolio workstream references in the  implementation stage of the migration.
#### Tools
Portfolio playbook templates
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Finalized  process for prioritization
