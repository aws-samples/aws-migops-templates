S/4 featurepack analysis
Run continuous configuration checks
Continuous Testing
**Run continuous change impact analysis**
This task involves continuously running change impact analysis that will allow the team to continuously monitor changes for immediate detection of issues caused by recent code or environment changes, S/4 feature pack analysis, and configuration checks.

**Run release change impact analysis**
This task involves the continuous execution of impact analyses throughout the project to maintain high-quality software standards and ensure alignment with project requirements. By leveraging SAP Change Impact Analysis,  automates the detection and assessment of changes, allowing the team to address test coverage issues promptly and efficiently.

## Task 2: Continuously Optimize IT Operations
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to continuously improve IT operations (e.g. via automation, or switching from a re-active to a pro-active operations approach). **[Customer COE and CIO Guides ](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/ccoe/cio-customer-coe-guides.html)**in Customer Center of Expertise portal has more details on improvement options.

One approach to improve IT operations is to set up an **[Advanced Customer COE](https://support.sap.com/support-programs-services/ccoe/advanced.html)**. The advanced certification for Customer COEs covers the full spectrum of SAP solution operations. Based on the SAP standards for solution operations and the SAP Activate methodology, a team with advanced certification has integrated quality management in place, bringing transparency to the challenges and issues faced by the organization as a whole. This is paramount for mission critical operations. Visibility, alignment, and a common understanding of those top issues are enabled through the center's ability to maintain a single source of truth - one central area where everything is tracked and from which all information flows.

Procedure:

Review **[What a Customer COE Should Know About Incident Managent](https://help.sap.com/doc/76658138f2954be4b357fef61ebab8a4/2017:1/en-US/index.html)** accelerator to also get an overview of various SAP support channels that are available.
Continuously improve IT operations for maximum efficiency by leverage support and services provided by SAP. Reference task Access SAP Support Service for details.
Access **[SAP Enterprise Support Report Reporting Cockpit](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/customerinsight360)** to refine indicators, improve and optimize the overall system landscape.
Use Early Watch Alert workspace tool to prevent errors and problems.
Leverage service from **[Incident Quality](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/incidentquality)** dashboard to check the quality of incidents to optimize the process.
## Task 3: Identify Innovation and Growth Opportunities
#### Description
The purpose of this deliverable is to improve and simplify your new solution to realize maximum benefit. On the one hand, this requires the periodic update, by implementing feature and support packs, to bring the latest innovations from SAP into your solution. On the other hand, a new planning cycle needs to be initiated together with your peers from the business units, to identify innovations which are mostly required.

SAP supports customer post Go-Live towards the Intelligent Enterprise. Customer is notified of potential capacity issues and should engage SAP Customer Success Partner to determine demands, understand risks and plan for future projects together with SAP in continuous transformation journey.
## Task 3: Subtask 1: Periodically Update your SAP System
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to evaluate new features, plan and execute frequent updates to keep SAP S/4HANA system current in order to support continuous business innovation.

SAP delivers one major release and two minor ones each year. Minor releases are the first two support package stacks, known as Feature Package Stack (i.e FPS01 FPS02). Support Package Stacks three and onwards (ie. SPS03, SP04, etc) are corrections only for mainstream maintenance and will last for five years for the respective major release.

Release upgrade should be planned and executed by customer. There are two approaches in upgrade: Technical and Functional. Technical approach focusing on updating software with minimum mandatory updates in configuration and custom code. Functional approach not only includes the technical aspect but more importantly deploys new business functionality as well, which involves more testing and user adoption efforts.

It is recommended for customer to take advantage of the once-a-year entitlement of the software upgrade offered by SAP and do the minimum changes required in Technical upgrade approach. This helps customer stay current as dictated by the SAP S/4HANA maintenance schedule, and with corrections and improvements that stabilize the system, improve performance, ensure the security of the system.

SAP perform the technical execution of all upgrades and patching to client 000. Customer or Partner performs the functional upgrade and patching activities on the application layer, ie. custom code remediation, notes implementation, simplification as per simplification lists etc.

While SAP have accountability in execution of certain changes, Customer owns the overall release management for all activities. SAP should be informed and involved to understand all customer releases and to initiate the approval process with Customer for any SAP releases.

Procedure:

Check **[Schedule for Release and Maintenance](https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance.html)** accelerator from support portal for timeline on new releases, feature packages and support packages.
Use **[SAP S/4HANA Whatâ€™s New Viewer](https://help.sap.com/doc/474a13c5e9964c849c3a14d6c04339b5/100/en-US/8880de6dbfb94ea3b0de1f26b40816dc.html)** to evaluate new features for the selected release(s) and feature package(s).
Reference the **[Upgrading SAP S/4HANA - How, Why, and Best Practice](https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/06/94ca0995-9d7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)** accelerator to determine the desirable upgrade path and choose between a minimum Technical approach or Functional approach of an improvement project.
Reference the SAP S/4HANA Upgrade and Product Integration Roadmap in Roadmap Viewer to plan and execute the upgrade project.
Create Service Request in SAP for Me in Services & Support dashboard to request the software update of the selected release and feature package as needed.

## Task 3: Subtask 2: Initiate a New Improvement and Innovation Project
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to initiate a new project to continue the improvement and innovation cycle.

Improvements and innovations are not a one-step-process, but a continuous journey. After the initial go-live, business requirements may have changed, and company may have gained experience on what is possible with the new solutions from SAP. It is time to continue improve the business process efficiencies through expanded use of the SAP solutions.

SAP continuously inform the customer of new innovations in its solutions. New organization model like Customer Center of Expertise can be leveraged to check for continuous improvement potential of the SAP solutions to realize the entire value of company's investment. Customer Center of Expertise can also provide transparency and efficiency in the implementation of these improvements and innovations to meet business objectives and goals. Partner can also play a role in driving these improvements through project implementations.

Procedure:

1. Review the innovation and implementation strategy created initially.
2. Consolidate feedback and data from business process measures, monitoring, and analysis.
3. Deep dive into data collected regarding value realization, process conformance, etc and capture learnings.
4. Outline improvements and innovations in the content of Business Capabilities.
5. Use **[SAP Roadmap Explorer - Business Technology Platform](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=FIRST-LAST&sap-outbound-id=855486676BA0B23A27A161E146BEA8626BFAE4BD&sap-outbound-id=F84338300454061B469DD99EFA855784D1EE0293&PRODUCT=42F2E964FAAF1EDA9FF753E17F3000E5&smc_campaign_id=0000034720&source=email-smc#Q1%202022)** accelerator to review the product roadmap of new innovations from SAP.
