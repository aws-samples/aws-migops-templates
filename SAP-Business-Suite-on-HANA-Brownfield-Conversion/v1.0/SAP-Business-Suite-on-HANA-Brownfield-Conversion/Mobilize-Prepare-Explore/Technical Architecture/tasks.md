This task aims to validate the initial sizing estimated during the Discovery phase.

Procedure:
1. Review [SAP Sizing â€“ Home Page](https://www.sap.com/about/benchmark/sizing.what-is-sizing.html) accelerator.
2. Follow the sizing procedures documented in SAP Note 1793345 - Sizing for SAP Suite on HANA and SAP Note 1872170 - Business Suite on HANA and S/4HANA sizing report.
3. Determine hardware requirements using the [HANA Quick Sizer](https://apps.support.sap.com/sap(bD1lbiZjPTAwMQ==)/bc/bsp/sap/qs_oberflaeche/hana.do?sap-language=en&).
4. Adjust the initial sizing to reflect decisions on functional enhancements, a potential new technical design, and requirements arising from advanced downtime minimization options.
5. Run this activity for all related infrastructure components (e.g., Front End Server).
6. If the initial sizing agreed on the RISE contract is not aligned with the recent estimation, discuss the options with your Account Executive.
