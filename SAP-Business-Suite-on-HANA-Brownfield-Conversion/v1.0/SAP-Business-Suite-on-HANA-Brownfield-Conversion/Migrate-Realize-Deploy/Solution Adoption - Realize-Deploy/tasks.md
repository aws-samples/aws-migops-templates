## Task 1: Detailed Change Impact Analysis
#### Description
The purpose of this deliverable is to gain insights into how the implementation of the SAP system will affect specific groups of stakeholders. The implementation of a new SAP system goes beyond being solely an IT project and has wide-ranging impacts on the entire organization. Evaluating these impacts requires a good understanding of both the current situation and the envisioned future state. A change impact analysis is best conducted in a workshop setting, where experts from various organizational units and diverse backgrounds can engage in discussions that often uncover valuable insights to facilitate the organizational transition. This collaborative approach promotes a shared understanding of upcoming challenges among project stakeholders. Following the assessment, it is essential to address the identified areas for action with appropriate activities.
## Task 1: Subtask 1: Prepare Change Impact Workshops
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to bring the right people together for the assessment and ensure a smooth execution of the workshop. A crucial step in this process is to reach a consensus regarding the appropriate level of detail for discussing the impacts on the new SAP business processes. Breaking down the business process into excessively granular components can result in unnecessary effort, while keeping the discussion too abstract may risk overlooking essential information. Typically, workshop participants consist of managers of the affected business units, alongside selected process owners, subject matter experts, or key users who possess in-depth knowledge of the processes involved. It is recommended to divide the overall implementation scope, possibly by process scope areas, and plan for several short sessions to ensure focused discussions. Additionally, it is essential to prepare the necessary templates in advance.

Procedure:

1. Compile a list of relevant SAP business processes and create assessment templates using the **[Detailed Change Impact Analysis](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/DetailedChangeImpactAnalysis_v1.0.pptx)** accelerator.
2. Identify and assign workshop participants.
3. Schedule change impact workshops.
## Task 1: Subtask 2: Conduct Change Impact Assessment
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to identify the implications of the new SAP business processes for various groups of stakeholders. It is beneficial to have the workshops led by an impartial facilitator. This fosters a comprehensive examination of the change impacts, encompassing not only process and technological changes, but also considerations related to organization and people. The facilitator can also support the group in reaching a consensus on quantifying the change impacts, using categories like high, medium, low, or no impact. These ratings aid in identifying the extent of impact for each business process and stakeholder group, enabling the prioritization of mitigation activities. It is imperative to document both pertinent insights into change impacts and suggestions for specific actions during the workshop.

Procedure:

1. Introduce the workshop approach, using the [Guiding Questions](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/GuidingQuestions_v1.0.pptx) accelerator.
2. Discuss and and assign ratings to change impacts for all relevant SAP business processes, involving all stakeholder groups responsible for executing these processes using the [Detailed Change Impact Analysis](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/DetailedChangeImpactAnalysis_v1.0.pptx) accelerator.
3. Document relevant insights and proposals for concrete activities.
## Task 1: Subtask 3: Manage Change Impacts
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to facilitate a seamless transition for all affected stakeholder groups to the new SAP solution and the adoption of best practice processes. Representing the workshop outcomes, especially the quantitative ratings visually (e.g., in the form of a heat map), enables the swift identification of areas requiring attention. The initial ideas already collected during the workshops should then be further developed and refined. Typically, some of these activities fall within the scope of organizational change management. Others may concern training, cut-over procedures, or measures to be implemented within the individual business units. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the change manager to ensure that all activities are consolidated into an action plan with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for execution.

Procedure:

1. Consolidate and visually represent the outcomes of the workshops, utilizing the **[Result Visualization](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/ResultVisualizationTemplate_v1.0.pptx)** accelerator.
2. Collect additional suggestions for addressing identified areas requiring action.
3. Define an action plan and assign distinct responsibilities for each activity using the **[Action Plan](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/ActionPlan_v1.0.pptx)** accelerator.
## Task 2: Enablement Content Development
