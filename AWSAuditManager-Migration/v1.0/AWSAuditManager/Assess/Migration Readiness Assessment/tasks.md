# Module: Migration Readiness Assessment
## Task 1: MRA - Review objectives and best practices
#### Description
The migration readiness assessment (MRA) is a critical early step in your migration journey. It helps you to assess the readiness of your application to migrate to AWS. This task helps you to gain critical insights regarding readiness, and to build a plan to close the identified gaps.
The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as you expand your adoption into AWS.
As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives might include building an overall vision, creating a reliable implementation roadmap, identifying gaps, providing corrective actions, and so on.
The MRA also includes reviewing your current architecture, security, and governance, and preparing for cloud adoption by creating concrete deliverables. By validating migration readiness against the available best practices, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of your current architecture and avoid possible roadblocks while migrating.For more information about the MRA, see [Migration Readiness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-readiness/).
#### Acceptance Criteria
Review the current architecture and identify strengths and weaknesses.
## Task 2: MRA - Pre-workshop activities
#### Description
Perform pre-workshop activities as a first step in the MRA. The pre-workshop activities include the following:
* Identifying attendees
* Pre-workshop questionnaire
* Planning the delivery (general and technical scope)
#### Acceptance Criteria
Create a list of attendees who support the MRA delivery, and create a pre-workshop questionnaire.
## Task 2: Subtask 1: Subtask 1: Identifying stakeholders
#### Description
Create a list of attendees who will be part of a unified team that supports the MRA delivery. The attendees include a migration expert who facilitates the assessment activities, a customer expert who drives the customer relationship, and so on.
