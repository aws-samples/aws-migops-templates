# Module: Introduction to the journey
## Task 1: Migration scenario
#### Description
System conversion is a transition scenario that existing SAP ERP customers can opt to apply to convert their existing SAP ECC 6.x solution to SAP S/4HANA. This includes retaining their business data, custom development, business processes and configuration. 

While availing the latest features of S/4HANA, customers may want to minimize change initially and then innovate selectively going forward. 

This journey is for customers running SAP ECC 6.x on any non-HANA database.
