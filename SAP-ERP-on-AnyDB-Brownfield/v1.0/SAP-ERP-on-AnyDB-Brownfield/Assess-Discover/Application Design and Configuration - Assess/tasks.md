## Task 9: Define the Analytics Architecture
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to evaluate the impact of RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition on the company’s analytics architecture. The aim is to create a specific roadmap for analytics protecting past investments and innovating via new platform capabilities. This task is optional. However, SAP recommends to take the opportunity to adjust your company’s analytics strategy by considering the analytics capabilities of SAP S/4HANA.

The introduction of RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition into your solution landscape is an ideal opportunity to review and potentially adjust your company’s analytics architecture. There are many reasons why:
1. SAP S/4HANA and SAP BW/4HANA bring new analytics capabilities.
2. The business data structure significantly changes with SAP S/4HANA.
3. There are many new analytic products from SAP which perfectly integrate with SAP S/4HANA.

Procedure:
Review and adjust the analytics architecture you should look from a holistic perspective taking SAP and non-SAP components into account as necessary. The strategy should consider:
Product options like:
Embedded Analytics
Stand-alone SAP BW and SAP BW/4HANA
SAP Digital Boardroom
Front-end options like:
SAP BusinessObjects BI Suite
SAP Analytics Cloud
Data model and access method changes like:
CDS (Core Data Services)
Embedded Analytics
Options with respect to data persistence

The “Accelerator(s)” section within this task lists many information sources for both the tools and strategy, to make you familiar with the options you have. The analytics road maps for “Solutions” and “Products” are located in the general SAP roadmaps at sap.com, under “Platform & Technology.”
The ideal analytics strategy should be based on a customer specific set of decision criteria such as:

* Functional analytics requirements, e.g. for Operational Reporting and real-time Reporting
* Handling of historical data
* Maintenance Schedule
* Data responsibility and ownership
* Complexity and number of data sources
