## Task 1: Subtask 1: Plan and Execute Agile Sprints
#### Description
The project team runs the Realize phase in sequence of sprints in which the project team follows the process outlined below. The goal of these sprints is to incrementally and iteratively build the solution capabilities captured in the backlog, test them and review their completion with the customer process owners (product owner in agile terminology).

During each sprint the project team conducts following activities:

Procedure:

1. Sprint Planning Meeting
* At the beginning of the sprint the project team runs a planning meeting during which, select the highest priority items from the backlog and conduct detailed planning for the execution activities in the sprint.
* Decompose each backlog item further to tasks that need to be completed during the sprint. These tasks may be configuration, coding, unit testing, data preparation, documentation and others.
* Capture these tasks in the sprint backlog and estimate to validate the original estimates for each backlog item.
* Ensure all details in the backlog item so the team can complete the topic as efficiently as possible. In addition, ensure that team has sufficient capability to finalize all items in a timely basis.
2. Sprint Execution Activities
* Execute the tasks that have been planned and keep track of the progress on the team board. The team board contains swim lanes showing the status of each backlog item and each task.
* Use boards on the wall and use the post-it notes to keep visual track of their progress.
* Regularly update the burn-down chart that is used to track the progress of completing the individual tasks and backlog items.
* Review the progress daily in the daily stand-up meeting.
3. Daily Stand-up Meeting
The daily stand-up meeting is not a project status meeting, but rather a session designed to help the team communicate the progress with each other.
During the daily stand-up meeting the team members review the:
Progress they have made since last meeting;
Plans for activities and tasks until the next meeting
Any issues of blockers that may prevent them from completing the tasks they are working on.
4. Sprint Demo
* Towards the end of the sprint the team conduct the sprint demo meeting during which the team demonstrates to the business owners (product owner in agile projects) the completed functionality.
* Seek acceptance of the completed features. During this meeting the business owner may request additional items to be added to the backlog.
* It is recommended that the team must preview the functionality with process owners prior to this meeting.
* Have business process owners demo the completed functionality to the rest of the business users and decisions makers.
5.Sprint Retrospective
* SCRUM Master organizes and facilitates the retrospective meeting for the team.
* Schedule the meeting shortly after the sprint demo meeting.
* Continuously improve the Scrum process using lessons learned from the sprint execution.
* Ask meeting participants to answer the following questions:
* What went well during the sprint?
* What do we want to preserve?
* What can be improved for the next sprint and how?
* Selects one or two improvement opportunities and put it into the backlog for the next sprint. This way the agile process gets improved in an incremental way and remains responsive to the changing environment of the project
