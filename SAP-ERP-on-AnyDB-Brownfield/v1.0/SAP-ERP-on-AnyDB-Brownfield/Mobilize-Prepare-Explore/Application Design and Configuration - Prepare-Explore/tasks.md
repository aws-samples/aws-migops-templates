#### Description
The purpose of this task is to execute the Data Volume Management (DVM), which is also known as Data Archiving. After the different DVM analyses have been performed on the system, it is time to customize the required archiving settings for selected archiving objects. Refer to the accelerator SAP Help - Data Archiving Process to customize, define a Data Volume Strategy and start the archiving execution.


Additionally, it is highly recommended to execute housekeeping activities on identified technical tables. For reference, the accelerators [SAP Blog - SAP S/4HANA 2022 System Conversion Steps & Details - How to be prepared](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/09/sap-s-4hana-2022-system-conversion-steps-details-how-to-be-prepared/) and [SAP Note 2388483 - How-To: Data Management for Technical Tables can be reviewed.](https://me.sap.com/notes/2388483)


Housekeeping of technical tables will help delete outdated and unnecessary data such as: Communication, Logging and Tracing, Administration, Analysis, Metadata, Staging, Auditing.


If after the RUN phase of the project there are requirements to further reduce the Random-Access Memory needs of the HANA Hardware, SAP HANA Native Storage Extension (NSE) can be explored. SAP HANA NSE is a feature that can be used to manage less-frequently accessed data without fully loading it into memory. The accelerators[ SAP HANA Native Storage Extension ](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-administration-guide/sap-hana-native-storage-extension)and SAP Note 2799997 - FAQ: SAP HANA Native Storage Extension (NSE) can be reviewed.


1. Identify the tables that are critical for archiving, customize the archiving parameters and start the archiving activities.
2. Check the Data Management Guide available in the Data Volume Management area. SAP Note 2243625 - Data Volume Management Value Map - SAP Enterprise Support provides SAP Enterprise Support offerings in the context of Data Volume Management.
3. Review the technical tables and start the housekeeping activities with reference in SAP Note 2388483 - How-To: Data Management for Technical Tables.
4. Check data on the SAP Readiness Check.
5. Check SAP Note 1872170 - ABAP on HANA sizing report (S/4HANA, Suite on HANA...).

7. Check the recommendations on SAP Note 2044468 - FAQ: SAP HANA Partitioning including the partition criteria for important tables.
## Task 12: Subtask 2: Synchronization of Customers/Vendors into Business partners CVI
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to carry out the synchronization of Customers, Vendors, and Contact Persons into business partners.


As explained in the accelerator [SAP Blog - S/4HANA RIG assets for your functional pre-conversion projects](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/11/15/s-4hana-rig-assets-for-your-functional-pre-conversion-projects-customer-vendor-integration-and-reconciliation-of-financial-data/), in SAP S/4HANA the leading mandatory technical object for customers and vendors is the Business Partner. To ensure a successful system conversion, all Customers, Vendors, and Contact Persons must be converted into Business Partners in the SAP ERP System before starting the technical conversion of the system.


Once successfully completing the synchronization in the sandbox system, all the same master data corrections in the productive system should also be completed. By using this approach, the master data issues will be identified and knowledge of how to efficiently correct the same issues in the productive source system will be known.
Prerequisites:

1. Create a Sandbox system (which is a recent copy of your productive SAP ERP system)
2. Review the [SAP S/4HANA Cookbook - Customer/Vendor Integration](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/S4H.0781%20SAP%20S4HANA%20Cookbook%20Customer%20Vendor%20Integration.pdf) to learn what are all the activities that need to be executed for CVI synchronization.
3. If possible, implement the TCI Note for CVI: SAP Note 2951811 - Transport-based correction instructions (TCIs) for customer vendor integration or the SAP Notes needed for CVI implementation.
4. If you are using customer-specific fields (enhancements) in Customer or Vendor master, you need to include those fields in transaction BP. Integrate these custom fields to Business Partner so that maintenance of these fields is possible after moving to S/4HANA. Please refer to SAP Note 2309153 - BP_CVI: Guideline Version 1.14 for customer enhancements in CVI and SAP Note 2295823 - BP_CVI: Transfer of customer / vendor fields to the business partner
5. If you are using other SAP solutions that require Business Partners’ integration, you need to perform the pre-conversion actions. For instance, for SAP CRM you must follow the instructions described in the SAP Note 2285062 - S4TWL: Business partner data exchange between SAPCRM and S/4 HANA, on-prem.
6. If employee vendors exist in the SAP ERP system, the employee vendors will have to be converted to BPs of category “Person” during CVI synchronization. Please refer to the SAP Note - 3362655 - Mapping of the Bus Partner Category as Person during Employee Vendor Migration.
7. Customize the system as needed. For example, the number ranges, BP Grouping, and so on.
8. Correct all the data issues and carry out the synchronization in the sandbox system.
9. Perform all the same master data corrections in the productive SAP ERP system.
## Task 12: Subtask 3: Reconciliation of Financial Data
#### Description
he purpose of this task aims to find and resolve Finance data inconsistencies within the source SAP ERP system for financial postings that will be transformed into the S/4HANA financial data model during a System Conversion. It is crucial to address all financial data inconsistencies early to mitigate any potential impact on the project timeline. This task focuses on financial inconsistency detection and data preparations from a functional point of view.

Prerequisite:

Have access to Conduct Functional Review Workshop results from the Discovery Phase.
Have completed the task Perform Data Volume Management.
Procedure:

1. Build a Sandbox system from a recent copy of the ECC Productive system.
2. Activate SAP reconciliation and analysis tools in the current ERP system by importing the following SAP Notes into the ERP system:
SAP Note 2755360 - Reconciliation prior to S/4HANA Conversion
SAP Note 2887318 - Reconciliation, Analysis and Correction of G/L Inconsistencies
SAP Note 3129858 - Reconciliation report for Material Ledger
SAP Note 2896400 - Reconciliation of Asset Accounting Inconsistencies in ECC prior to S/4HANA Conv.
3. Refer to the SAP Note 2332030 - Conversion of accounting to SAP S/4HANA and become familiar with the Finance Conversion Guide section 6: Prepare Phase: Getting Your System Ready for the Conversion.
 4. Refer to the SAP Note 2450377 - Conversion of SAP S/4HANA Finance to SAP S/4HANA - Migration Steps for Finance and review which preparation steps are required for the project.
 5. Review and become familiar with the reconciliation error messages guides found in the following SAP Notes:
SAP Note 2714344 - Financial data migration to SAP S/4HANA Most frequent Error Messages
SAP Note 2389581 - Resolve findings of core ERP CO-PC-ACT S/4HANA pre checks for Material Ledger
SAP Note 3038014 - Errors in Migration Precheck Report for Asset Accounting
6. Perform data correction activities in the Sandbox and update the runbook with them.
7. Reference the runbook notes to perform the data correction activities in the productive SAP ERP system.

Notes:

The consistency check reports cannot identify or anticipate all inconsistencies in the preparation phase due to database and ERP table structure limitations. In special cases, some inconsistencies may be initially identified only after a completed system conversion to S/4HANA.
Reference the accelerator [SAP Blog - S/4HANA RIG assets](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/11/15/s-4hana-rig-assets-for-your-functional-pre-conversion-projects-customer-vendor-integration-and-reconciliation-of-financial-data/) for your functional pre-conversion projects to learn about data inconsistencies root causes and to see a consolidated view of resources associated with these tasks.
While certain issues can be automatically addressed using SAP tools, others may necessitate the submission of incident messages to SAP Support, leading to potential delays. Moreover, if the remedial actions result in alterations to account balances, it is crucial to examine the changes and their impact with the business and the auditors.
Set up a detailed runbook for the project and update it with each iteration attempt.
## Task 12: Subtask 4: Add-On Compatibility
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to identify and execute any necessary preparatory actions related to the previously identified add-ons that should be considered during the SAP S/4HANA conversion project in order to guarantee their compatibility with the selected target SAP S/4HANA version and decrease the risk of impacting the conversion project viability.

The Add-ons preparation activities for the target SAP S/4HANA version conversion may imply in pre-requisites such as (but not limited to) license change needs, minimum required version for the conversion (in some cases may require a focused upgrade project), complete solution architecture review or even component uninstallation. To understand the available Add-on types and how to handle them during a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition please check the following accelerator SAP Blog - Handling Add-Ons during a system conversion/upgrade to SAP S/4HANA.

For 3rd Party Solutions architecture alternatives in RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, please check accelerator [SAP Blog - Third-Party Solutions usage in RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/05/third-party-solutions-usage-in-rise-with-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition/)

1. Execute Maintenance Planner tool considering the selected target SAP S/4HANA version.
2. Based on the add-on related outcomes from the Conduct Technical Review Workshop and the Maintenance Planner execution identify the add-ons which requires further actions, for instance, the ones that the compatibility with the target SAP S/4HANA version couldn´t be defined, that should be uninstalled or with missing licenses messages.
3. For each add-on search for specific compatibility/uninstallation related information in SAP notes (if the solution was licensed from SAP) or directly within the add-on vendor resources (if the solution was licensed directly with the vendor).
4. Alternatively, reach out to the add-on vendor representative to clarify further compatibility, license, or uninstallation procedure details.
5. For add-ons that should be uninstalled:
* Validate if an add-on specific uninstallation package is available. If not, it may be necessary to upgrade it to a minimum version in which the uninstallation is technically feasible.
* Execute the uninstallation process for the specific add-on or plan to do it as part of the SAP S/4HANA conversion procedure as per the vendor´s recommendation.
* Only if no other uninstallation alternatives are available (for instance, vendor is not available anymore or vendor cannot technically offer the uninstallation solution for specific reasons) customers may try to create an uninstallation configuration for such 3rd Party Add-ons at their own risk. Please check the following accelerator for further details and consider all disclaimers carefully. Reference S[AP Help - Uninstallation Configuration for an ABAP Software Component Version from 3rd-Party Vendor.](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ADD-ON_INSTALLATION_TOOL_AND_SUPPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER/bf699c5080df4b9599d57961a77807bb/8b259130140644e28b19c69a480d163d.html)
6. For each remaining add-on relevant for the SAP S/4HANA conversion clarify license requirements and possible adjustment needs with your vendor´s account representative.
7.  After all add-on identified recommendations and actions are finally executed rerun Maintenance Planner and refresh the Add-on compatibility information within SAP Readiness Check.
8. Evaluate the results to guarantee that the already technically executed add-on preparation actions have been successfully implemented and that the remaining add-on compatibility alerts/errors (if any) have a future action plan already defined.

## Task 12: Subtask 5: Cleanup Unused Code
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to decommission custom code, which is not in use, before the system conversion project. Although this task is optional, it is highly recommended to avoid adjustment efforts for coding which is not required.

Prerequisites:

Collect custom code usage during a relevant period (recommended: one year, minimum: six months), through:

Transaction SCMON: SAP Note 2679723 - ABAP Call Monitor
Transaction SUSG: to collect usage data in production system
Procedure:

1. Access SAP Fiori Custom Code Migration App - available in SAP S/4HANA 1809 or higher and in SAP BTP, ABAP Environment.
2. Activate transaction SUSG to aggregate information from transaction SCMON. Use SAP Note 2701371 - Recommendations for aggregating usage data using transaction SUSG and SAP Blog - Aggregate usage data in your production system with SUSG transaction for reference.
3. Using Custom Code Migration App, define the scope of objects that need to be taken over to SAP S/4HANA. Unused custom code can be deleted using deletion transport requests during the system conversion.
4. Generate Deletion transport from Custom Code Migration App.
5. Perform backups.
6. Import deletion transport into SUM tool while in the uptime phase of your system conversion project.
## Task 13: System Conversion Strategy
#### Description
The purpose of this deliverable is to evaluate and decide the actions that each customer will take to:

1. Mitigate risks, deciding the number of conversion cycles to be performed.
2. Reduce the impact on the current operation, defining dual maintenance approach.
3. Meet business expectations, selecting the system conversion approach that will be used considering the business restrictions like the maximum business downtime.
## Task 13: Subtask 1: Define Technical System Conversion Approach
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to evaluate and define the technical SAP S/4HANA system conversion approach best suitable to your business and technical requirements.

While planning to execute your SAP S/4HANA system conversion it is important to evaluate the possible system conversion approaches in an early project stage since they may directly influence the conversion project plan activities, timelines, effort or costs. By understanding the maximum supported downtime for your business operations combined with previously gathered technical information usually discussed during the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition sales engagement and/or technical information from the SAP Readiness Check for Conversion such as target system sizing and planned downtime calculator results.

Procedure:

1. Review the [Conversion Approaches and Downtime Optimization Techniques.](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/Conversion%20Approaches%20and%20Downtime%20Optimization%20Techniques.pdf)
2. Identify the business downtime window accepted by the business operations.
3. Have a good understanding of the different technical SAP S/4HANA conversion approaches and downtime optimization techniques provided either by SUM tool or SAP services team.
4. Review and consider any previously discussed information about system conversion strategy/downtime reduction requirements during the sales cycle or previous phases.
5. Choose the best suitable option considering the project´s requirements and/or restriction.
6. Identify the prerequisites or specifics for the selected approach (if any) and take them into consideration in your project planning.
7. After the first Sandbox conversion check the information available in the [Technical Downtime Optimization App](https://me.sap.com/app/downtimeoptimization) and investigate further downtime reduction options or procedures to be taken into consideration in the next conversion cycles and plan accordingly.
8. 
## Task 13: Subtask 2: Define Conversion Cycles
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to define the number of conversion cycles required to meet the project requirements.

SAP recommends a minimum of 5 cycles. But depending on the technical system conversion approach defined it could be needed to consider additional iterations.


Procedure:

1. Review the [Conversion Cycle Considerations and Risks.](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/Conversion%20Cycle%20Considerations%20and%20Risks.pdf)
2. Determine the business’s ability to absorb unexpected extensions of project timelines due to unexpected issues arising during an original system conversion.
3. Determine what is the business acceptable downtime window for the Production conversion.
4. Determine what is the acceptable length for a configuration freeze after the Development system has been converted but before the Production system has been converted.
* Define “Configuration freeze” and the synchronization process after Development and Production have been converted.
5. Determine the number of required test conversion cycles and success criteria for each cycle based on the first three steps.
6.  Develop the project plan timelines based on Step 4.
## Task 13: Subtask 3: Define the Need of Dual Maintenance
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to confirm the need for dual maintenance during the system conversion project. When confirmed, define the N+1 landscape that meets each customer's requirements.

A conversion project can run for several months. During that time, the business may require changes to the production environment, prior to the final conversion, to continue successful operations. This may mean new configuration, code modifications or activating new functionality. The decision must be made how to apply these changes in the temporary SAP ERP landscape (N+1) and the production RISE S/4HANA landscape (Future N) prior to final Cutover of production to keep all the landscapes in-sync.

Procedure:

1. Review the [Dual Maintenance Considerations and Risks](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/Dual%20Maintenance%20Considerations%20and%20Risks.pdf).
2. Decide if a complete freeze for any changes to the original SAP ERP landscape is possible. If not, proceed to procedure step 
3. Define the manual processes, procedures, and approvals for maintaining the original SAP ERP landscape (Current N), the temporary SAP ERP landscape (N+1) and RISE S4/HANA landscape (Future N) in sync with the same configuration, functionality and/or code modifications.
## Task 14: System Conversion Execution of the Sandbox Environment
#### Description
This deliverable aims to run all the functional and technical activities needed to complete the conversion of the first sandbox system. After this conversion is finished, the project team must evaluate if they are ready to move to the productive landscape or if it is convenient to perform another sandbox iteration. As this first conversion cycle may reveal unknown issues/activities, the project plan must be evaluated and adjusted accordingly depending on the potential impact.
## Task 14: Subtask 1: Document System Conversion Runbook
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to create a Runbook with all the activities performed in each SAP S/4HANA system conversion iteration from the sandbox, Development, Quality, mock conversion, dress rehearsal, and finally the Production system.

As explained in the task Define Conversion Cycles, SAP recommends a minimum of 5 conversion cycles. The first cycle must be the sandbox system conversion. The sandbox system must be a recent copy of the Production system to replicate how the Production system conversion will behave and to get an idea of how long the system conversion process will take. The sandbox system conversion typically takes the longest since it will be the first time executing the system conversion in the environment. This is when the project team must start creating the system conversion runbook.

Here is an example of a 6-cycle system conversion project:

Cycle 1 – Sandbox system conversion
Cycle 2 – Development system conversion
Cycle 3 – QA system conversion
Cycle 4 – Pre-PRD Mock system conversion
Cycle 5 – Dry Run / Dress Rehearsal system conversion
Cycle 6 – Production system conversion

By the time of cycle 4, all issues encountered should already be documented with the fix/resolution instructions. In the final cycle before the production cutover (Dry Run/Dress Rehearsal), the Runbook should be finalized and executed with the project team and business users to validate the activities for the Production cutover.

Procedure:

1. Establish the Runbook owner. This person will be responsible for documenting and coordinating the activities within the project team.
2. Define the template to be used. The Runbook must capture and document all screenshots, input parameters, timings, error resolutions and task owners to be able to optimize each system conversion.
3. Document the sandbox conversion. It is important to include the sequence of activities considering mandatory predecessors. Be aware that although a Runbook from a previous project could be used as a reference, the steps will not be the same since a Runbook is project-specific.
4. For each system conversion, the project team must validate and refine the activities documented in the Runbook to ensure a smooth execution.
5. By the time of Production cutover, it should be possible to execute all activities and tasks as documented in the Runbook including expected runtimes and error resolutions.
## Task 14: Subtask 2: Technical Pre-Conversion Activities
#### Description
This task aims to review and execute the technical pre-conversion steps in the sandbox system during an SAP S/4HANA conversion and move to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.

The sandbox landscape must be initially created for both the source SAP ERP system in the customer's current infrastructure and the target SAP S/4HANA system in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition:

1. Source SAP ERP Sandbox system: It must be created as a most recent copy of the productive SAP ERP system. Ideally, this system should already contain the preparatory tasks described in the “Pre-Conversion Projects Execution” deliverable. It is recommended to have similar hardware resources comparable to the productive system to include performance optimizations in future conversion cycles.
2. Target SAP S/4HANA Sandbox system: a SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition system should be temporarily selected as the sandbox conversion target. The Quality system would be a good choice since it would have hardware resources comparable to the Production system and provide enough time to utilize that target system for testing until the actual Quality system is converted. The delivery of the selected target system must be aligned with the SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) team to match the expected date as per the project plan.
3. OS-level access on servers managed by the SAP Enterprise Cloud Services team is not allowed for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Therefore, a migration server is supplied during the conversion project, which allows the technical conversion team members to have more flexibility and control during the actual system conversion execution. The SUM tool will be executed on this additional temporary server where root access is allowed, and the target SAP S/4HANA ABAP application server will be installed initially. Later, all ABAP processes on the migration server must be stopped. The SAP Enterprise Cloud Services team will reset the database credentials and start the final SAP S/4HANA ABAP application servers where no OS-level access is provided.

## Task 14: Subtask 3: Functional Pre-Conversion Activities
#### Description
This task aims to carry out the pre-conversion activities and prepare the SAP ERP system for a smooth technical conversion of the system to SAP S/4HANA.

1. Execute Simplification Item (SI) Check and review the errors and warnings by selecting “Display Last Check Result.”
How to access the SI Check Result is shown below.
Transaction Code: SE38
Program: /SDF/RC_START_CHECK

2. The SI Check Items will contain errors and warnings from areas such as Finance, Logistics, Procurement, sales, etc. Therefore, the next step is to identify and group the items by area and assign them to the appropriate teams to work on the solution.
3. Review the SAP Notes related to each simplification item and subsequently organize the "SI resolution workshops.” Ensure the inclusion of all necessary stakeholders in these sessions.
4. Ensure all the "Red" errors are addressed and resolved. Additionally, thoroughly inspect the "Yellow" warnings and take necessary remedial measures. Ensuring that all the "Red" errors have been solved before initiating the technical system conversion is crucial. Failure to do this will render the Software Update Manager (SUM) tool incapable of completing the system conversion. Following are explanations of a couple of "Red" errors:
5. Error: SI2: Logistics_PP-MRP: The SI Check references to the SAP Note 2268045 - S4TWL - Storage Location MRP for this error. This SAP note details the error and explains how to resolve the issue. Please refer to the accelerator [How To Clear SI2 Logistics_PP-MRP for more information.](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/How%20to%20clear%20SI2%20Logistics_PP-MRP.docx)
6. Error: SI5: MasterData_PM: The SI Check references to the [S4TWL - Simplification of Copy/Reference Handling for this error](https://me.sap.com/notes/2330063). This note details the error and explains how to resolve the issue. Please refer to the accelerator [How to clear SI5 MasterData_PM for more information.](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/How%20to%20clear%20SI5%20MasterData_PM.docx)
7. Record the simplification items explaining that some post-conversion activities are needed. Divide the items by their respective areas and allocate them to the relevant teams.
8. Document every step of the functional pre-conversion activities in the Runbook previously defined.

## Task 14: Subtask 5: System Conversion Execution
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to execute the technical system conversion steps in the sandbox system during the system conversion and move to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.

Even though the technical system conversion tasks for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition are similar to the ones needed for a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA (On-Premise), there are a few important differences to be considered:

The system conversion activities in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition are executed on a migration server (provided only during project time) to comply with the security standards defined for SAP Cloud solutions as already explained in the “Technical Pre-Conversion Activities” task.
A continuous alignment between the customer/project team and the SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) team is critical to distribute, sequence, and deliver the activities according to each team’s responsibilities and contracted delivery model (such as service request lead times, incident priorities, and escalation/communication procedures).
The SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) team executes their own post-conversion activities in addition to the customer/project´s post-conversion procedures. Therefore, each system conversion execution and handover between the teams must be planned and coordinated properly.
For detailed information on the roles and responsibilities in transitioning to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, please check the accelerator [SAP S/4HANA, and ERP Cloud Services Documentation .](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/policies/hec-services.html?sort=latest_desc&search=RISE%20with%20SAP%20S%2F4HANA%20Cloud%2C%20private%20edition%20and%20SAP%20ERP%2C%20PCE%20Roles%20and%20Responsibilities)

## Task 16: Integration Review and Redesign
#### Description

Integration Review and Redesign
## Task 16: Subtask 1: Current Integrations Impact Analysis
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to identify and evaluate all the inbound and outbound integrations used in SAP ERP. Also, detect the integrations that will be impacted after the completion of the system conversion.


1. Identify the current integrations using the SAP Note 2913617 - SAP Readiness Check 2.0 report by expanding the 'Integration' section where the total number of integrations can be seen. Integrations will be classified by technology type, frequency of usage, interface direction, etc. Among other classifications, a subset of these interfaces will be classified as 'Impacted Interfaces.’ Additional details for each impacted interface can be reviewed here. Reasons for the type of impact are provided, whether due to missing functionality or similar issues. An SAP note is often suggested to check for further actions regarding the impacted interface.
2. Review, examine, and re-evaluate the business processes. Some processes may have changed or might no longer be necessary following a system conversion. SAP S/4HANA introduces a new simplified data model, which might lead to adjustments in integrations and interfaces that rely on the old data model.
3. Review the [Simplification List for S/4HANA ](https://help.sap.com/doc/c34b5ef72430484cb4d8895d5edd12af/2023/en-US/SIMPL_OP2023.pdf)or Simplification Item Catalog These resources provide, among other things, details and necessary instructions for programmers, consultants, and administrators to adjust the impacted interfaces and ensure that integrations continue to function correctly after the conversion.
4. A complementary method to identify impacted integrations is to utilize the ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC). This tool can assist in identifying custom objects such as custom BAPIs or IDOCs affected by a system conversion based on the simplification list. For additional information on how to set up the ABAP Test Cockpit, section 2, 'Custom Code Analysis Before System Conversion,' from the document Custom Code Migration Guide for SAP S/4HANA 2023 can be of reference. Depending on the chosen ABAP Test Cockpit approach, whether on-premise or in the Cloud, the following blog entries can be consulted: Remote Code Analysis in ATC - One Central Check System for Multiple Systems on Various Releases and How to use ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) in the Cloud as a Developer in an On-Premise System.
## Task 16: Subtask 2: Define Target Integration
#### Description
This task aims to formulate a strategic action plan to replace outdated integration technologies and remediate affected integrations.


1. Review Integration Options: Learn about the available integration solutions, such as the [SAP Integration Suite](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite) or Process Orchestration. Evaluate which option aligns best with your integration landscape and business requirements. The major difference lies in the deployment model – cloud versus on-premise –. This decision will significantly impact overall system flexibility, scalability, and cost. SAP Cloud Integration Suite is fully compatible with the current Integration trends and technologies, and its implementation could be considered a subsequent project once the System Conversion is accomplished.
2. Replace obsolete integration methods: If an interface employs an outdated integration method or a function not available in SAP S/4HANA, an alternative method is needed. For instance, if an interface uses an IDOC that is no longer available in SAP S/4HANA, this IDOC could be substituted with an API or an OData service that enables the exposure of the information for consumption. Interfaces impacted in this manner must be replaced with an alternative integration method to ensure that the associated business process remains operational in SAP S/4HANA.
3. Plan for future integration method replacements: There may be integrations that are not impacted by a system conversion but still employ outdated technologies or are on the verge of becoming obsolete. Replacement of such integration technologies should be contemplated as a subsequent project once the system conversion is accomplished. This strategy will confer several advantages, such as:

## Task 17: Additional Post-Conversion Activities of the Sandbox Environment
#### Description
This deliverable aims to ensure the completion of all the additional activities needed after the first conversion is finished. Carrying out those tasks is critical before moving to the productive landscape since it will help to reduce the complexity of the subsequent conversion cycles.

Prerequisite:

Have completed System Conversion Execution of the Sandbox Environment deliverable
## Task 17: Subtask 1: Enable SAP Fiori
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to activate and set up SAP Fiori Applications that will be tested in the Sandbox system.

Prerequisite:

Have completed the System Conversion Execution of the Sandbox Environment deliverable.

Procedure:

Follow the instructions listed in the task Activate SAP Fiori in the Initial System. Considering this is a system conversion, the SAP Fiori launchpad will not be set up in your system. Therefore, you must include that activity, as described in the Procedure Note(s) of the task mentioned before.
## Task 17: Subtask 2: Run Initial Testing
#### Description
The purpose of this task is to execute the first testing cycle in the converted sandbox system. There are two prominent testing cases to be performed:

Sprint 1 - Current processes: The goal is to validate that the processes are working as before. One example in Order to Cash will be to review an open sales order and complete the pending documents. It means creating the delivery, posting the good issue, creating the billing document, and finishing the collection. This testing cycle will help to confirm that the conversion has not affected processes that were not supposed to be impacted.
Sprint 2 - Improvement Opportunities: This converted system will help the customers confirm the value of SAP S/4HANA with their own data. Therefore, this test cycle must include some SAP Fiori apps identified in the task Run the Scope and Envision the Future Workshops. In case the SAP Fiori apps still need to be identified, a good starting point is to review in the[ SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library](https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/) the SAP Fiori lighthouse apps. Also, the SAP Fiori apps are related to the best practices.
Prerequisites:

Completed the System Conversion Execution of the Sandbox Environment deliverable.
Completed the Enable SAP Fiori task.
Procedure:

Each business unit must define the processes or individual transactions to be tested.
Also, define the SAP Fiori apps included in the testing.
Perform cycle one by testing the defined processes/transactions in SAP GUI.
Perform cycle two by testing the defined processes, including the different SAP Fiori apps agreed upon.
Document the findings and solve any issues before moving to the next conversion cycle.
The experience gained testing the SAP Fiori apps using each customer's data will help to reevaluate the UX strategy. Therefore, after cycle two, the project team must review and adjust the UX strategy, for instance, incorporating additional SAP Fiori apps for the first go-live.
## Task 17: Subtask 3: Resolve Inconsistencies in the Productive Landscape
#### Description
This task addresses what must be performed in the SAP ERP productive landscape after the system conversion of the Sandbox system. Depending on the result of the first conversion cycle, it must be evaluated if a new one is needed. The multiple sandbox conversion iteration approach allows testing and validation of the correction results before the conversion of the production system.

Prerequisite:

Have completed the Data Migration process in the Sandbox S/4HANA System.
Procedure:

Pre-conversion inconsistencies

From the system conversion Runbook, consolidate the corrections related to configuration, master data cleansing, and data reconciliation performed as part of the pre-conversion activities before the technical Sandbox conversion.
Carry out and validate data correction activities in the productive system according to the plan.
Execute and validate customizing correction activities in the DEV system and collect the changes in transport requests.
Follow the transport request strategy to transfer the configuration through the productive landscape.
Post-conversion inconsistencies for Finance

Analyze the data Migration Monitor (FINS_MIG_STATUS) results in the Sandbox to identify inconsistencies produced during the Data Migration process.
Review and familiarize yourself with the following SAP notes to learn about known data inconsistencies and their root causes. Also, potentially identify recommended corrective actions:
SAP Note 2714344 - Financial data migration to SAP S/4HANA Most frequent Error Messages
[Migration preparatory checks for FI-AA: Error messages and possible solutions](https://me.sap.com/notes/2618023)
SAP Note 3038014 - Errors in Migration Precheck Report for Asset Accounting
SAP Note 2389581 - Resolve findings of core ERP CO-PC-ACT S/4HANA pre checks for Material Ledger
Depending on the errors, a new Sandbox iteration may be needed. If that is the case, carry out and validate data correction activities in the latest Sandbox system and, depending on the result, perform the same activity in the productive system according to the plan.
If no additional Sandbox iteration is needed, carry out and validate data correction activities directly in the productive system according to the plan.
Execute and validate customizing correction activities in the DEV system and collect the changes in transport requests.
Follow the transport request strategy to transfer the configuration through the productive landscape.
