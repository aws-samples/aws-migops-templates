## Task 1: Review analysis and design
#### Description
The review of the design architecture needs to be done in a consistent manner, using an approach that encourages diving deep. The purpose of reviewing an architecture is to identify any critical issues that might need addressing or areas that could be improved. The outcome of the review is a set of actions that improve the experience of the mainframe migration using the workloads.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Reviewed design of the mainframe migration.
## Task 2: Define test scenarios
#### Description
Identify and define the test scenarios as part of the Migrate phase. The test scenarios must include the following: 

1) Integration and system testing
2) Performance testing
3) User acceptance testing


#### Acceptance Criteria
• Identified test scenarios for mainframe migration to AWS
## Task 3: Set up migration environments
#### Description
Set up the migration environments to enable migrations to AWS as part of the Migrate phase. The following migration environments need to be set up based on the mainframe application stack: 

1) Runtime environments
2) Database environments
3) Third-party environments
