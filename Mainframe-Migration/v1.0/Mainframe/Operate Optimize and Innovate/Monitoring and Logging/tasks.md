# Module: Monitoring and Logging
## Task 1: Monitoring
#### Description
Ensure that the best practices for areas such as monitoring, alerting, backups, and high availability are followed for all the applications hosted in AWS.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• List the application performance metrics that might be helpful in monitoring the overall application. Examples include average response times and system availability.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Set a threshold for each metric and monitor for healthy performance.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Monitor and satisfy all the security metrics detailed in the Mobilize phase.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Monitor cost usage for all the infrastructure components in AWS on a periodic basis.
## Task 1: Subtask 1: Set up performance monitoring
#### Description
Application performance monitoring is the process of using monitoring software and telemetry data to track key software application performance metrics. This ensures system availability, optimizes service performance and response times, and improves overall user experiences.  

It is critical to monitor the performance of the overall system as well as individual components of the system. 

For more information, see [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html).
#### Acceptance Criteria
• List the application performance metrics that might be helpful in monitoring the overall application. Examples include average response times and system availability metrics.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Set a threshold for each metric and monitor for healthy performance.
## Task 1: Subtask 2: Set up security and compliance monitoring
#### Description
Check against the security posture established in the Mobilize phase for each workload. 
1)	Identity and Access Management
2)	Logging and Monitoring
3)	Infrastructure Protection
4)	Data Protection 
5)	Incident Response
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Monitor and satisfy all the security metrics detailed in the Mobilize phase.
## Task 1: Subtask 3: Set up cost monitoring
#### Description
The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) provides estimated charges associated with AWS accounts. Each report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS products, usage type, and operation that are used in the AWS account. Customize the AWS CUR to aggregate the information by the hour, day, or month.

For more information, see [AWS CUR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html).
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Monitor cost usage of all the infrastructure components in AWS on a periodic basis.
## Task 2: Logging
#### Description
Ensure that the best practices for logging are followed for all the applications hosted in AWS. Set up a logging solution which would be scalable across all migrated mainframe applications in a centralized location. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Implemented application logging solution
