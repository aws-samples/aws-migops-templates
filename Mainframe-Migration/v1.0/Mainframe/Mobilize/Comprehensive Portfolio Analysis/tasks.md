# Module: Comprehensive Portfolio Analysis
## Task 1: Comprehensive discovery
#### Description
This stage of the assessment focuses on the initial steps of obtaining and analyzing data at the mainframe portfolio level. The main objective is to identify business drivers and collect general data from applications and infrastructure in order to obtain an initial view of the portfolio, including high-level technical and business attributes such as application names, environment, product versions, criticality, performance values, and others. This is essential for understanding the scope of the project, identifying initial migration candidates, and building the business case.

The following steps are preferred: 

1) Document portfolio business drivers
2) Review application, infrastructure attributes and data requirements
3) Establish default application prioritization criteria
4) Install, configure, and test discovery tooling for selected migration pattern
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ A detailed plan to perform migrating environment discovery including the scope, prioritization, configuration, and data collection.
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Documented migrating environment business drivers such as accelerating innovation, reducing operational and infrastructure costs, and increasing operational resiliency.
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Captured the complete application and infrastructure metadata of the mainframe applications.
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ A complete list of systems that will be part of the data collection.
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ A plan to iteratively collect data requirements of migrating applications.
6) Detailed knowledge of the migrating environment for mainframe applications.
## Task 2: Pattern and tool guidance for all apps
#### Description
There is no one-size-fits all for mainframe modernization to AWS. Depending on the business and IT strategy and on the mainframe-specific technical constraints, select the most suitable pattern for migration. If the mainframe is large enough to process multiple workloads, each workload’s characteristics can favor different patterns.

For the identified portfolio, the patterns are the following: 

1) Short-term migration with automated refactoring
2) Short-term migration with middleware emulation
3) Augmentation with data analytics
4) Augmentation with new channels

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Identified pattern for mainframe migration to AWS
## Task 3: Initial migration plan
#### Description
The initial migration planning task focuses on iterating the work initiated in the previous stages. The goal is to enrich the portfolio data and baseline a migration wave plan.

The mainframe migration plan must include the following:

1) Patterns
2) Tools
3) Resources
4) Priorities
5) Timeline
6) Acceptance criteria
7) POC candidates (if not done in the Assess phase)
8) Integrations


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ An initial migration plan for mainframe migration to AWS.
