# Module: Proof of Concept
## Task 1: Kick off POC
#### Description
After the comprehensive portfolio discovery is complete, do the following:  

1) Identify applications for a proof of concept.
2) Refine your migration plan and business cases.

Mainframe migrations can be done using two different strategies: 

1) Refactor
2) Replatform

After a subset of mainframe applications is identified for a POC migration, do the following: 

1) Allocate that teams that will perform the POC.
2) Create a POC migration plan with identified outcomes.
3) Set up AWS Cloud accounts.


#### Acceptance Criteria
• Kicked off POC with the identified applications.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Allocated project resources.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Completed POC migration plan.
## Task 2: Analysis and Setup 
#### Description
Based on the data from the portfolio discovery and analysis tasks, select the Mainframe migration pattern as part of the POC.  

Mainframe migrations can be done using two different patterns: 

1) Refactor
2) Replatform

Based on the chosen migration pattern, do the following:

1) Review the design and architecture of the migration applications.
2) Define test scenarios.
3) Set up migration environments.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Finalized a migration design architecture.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Defined test scenarios.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Set up migration environments.
## Task 2: Subtask 1: Review analysis and design
#### Description
The review of design architecture needs to be done in a consistent manner, using an approach that encourages diving deep. The purpose of reviewing an architecture is to identify any critical issues that might need addressing or areas that could be improved. The outcome of the review is a set of actions that improve the experience of the mainframe migration using the workloads.
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Reviewed the design of the mainframe migration. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Reviewed design of the mainframe migration. 
## Task 3: Build and Test
#### Description
After the migrating environments are set up in AWS for the POC, do the following: 

1) Migrate data using AWS Database Migration Service.
2) Migrate apps using the refactor or replatform pattern. 
3) Set up continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.

## Task 4: Deliver and review
#### Description
After the migrated environments are completed, the next step is to validate the environments and applications. Perform the following steps to ensure that validation is complete. 

1) Run integration and system testing
2) Run performance testing
3) Run user acceptance testing
4) Run HA/DR testing


#### Acceptance Criteria
• Successfully completed validation
