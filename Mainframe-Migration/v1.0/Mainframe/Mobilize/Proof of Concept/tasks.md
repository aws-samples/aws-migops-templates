#### Description
Migrating mainframe applications to AWS requires an approach with four phases: Assess, Mobilize, Migrate & Modernize, and Operate, Optimize & Innovate. It is important to get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase.

For an overview of the phases of a migration and the tools to use, see [AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html).
For an overview of the cloud migration process, see [cloud migration process](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/).
For an overview of the cloud migration process for mainframe workloads, see the [AWS Mainframe Modernization User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/what-is-m2.html).

For the identified portfolio, the patterns are the following: 

1) Short-term migration with automated refactoring
2) Short-term migration with middleware emulation
3) Augmentation with data analytics
4) Augmentation with new channels
