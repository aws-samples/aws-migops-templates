# Module: Mainframe Migration Pre kickoff
## Task 1: Informal conversation
#### Description
Migrating mainframe applications to AWS requires an approach with four phases: Assess, Mobilize, Migrate & Modernize, and Operate, Optimize & Innovate. It is important to get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase.

For an overview of the phases of a migration and the tools to use, see [AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html).
For an overview of the cloud migration process, see [cloud migration process](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/).
For an overview of the cloud migration process for mainframe workloads, see the [AWS Mainframe Modernization User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/what-is-m2.html).


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Learned about the four phases of a mainframe migration.
â€¢ Reviewed the list of AWS tools that are required in each phase of the migration.
## Task 2: Opportunity Qualification
#### Description
This task is for customers and partners to discuss the opportunity for modernization of mainframe workloads. Discuss the following topics: 

1) Mainframe agility in an on-premise environment
2) High costs associated with mainframes minimize innovation and experimentation
3) The flexibility of business processes and data is restricted
4) Finding experienced Mainframes specialists is challenging 

Discuss the benefits of Mainframe modernization in AWS: 

1) Increased agility
2) Cost savings
3) Improved innovation
4) Enhanced security
5) Scalability and elasticity 


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Documented the challenges of current on-premise mainframe workloads
2) Documented the benefits of mainframe modernization in AWS
## Task 3: First call presentation
#### Description
Prepare a first-call deck where you outline the best solutions and services that AWS provides for migrations. Present the deck to the relevant customer stakeholders. 

In the deck, address the following requirements, which are necessary for a successful migration: 

1) Planning for application portfolio
2) Building an operating model and service management framework
3) Using an experienced AWS partner for mainframe migrations
4) Introducing the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) for mainframe migrations


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ A presentation with the best solutions and services that AWS provides for mainframe migrations
## Task 4: Rough Order of Magnitude Estimate
#### Description
In this task you estimate the current mainframe resource consumption and map it to an AWS target architecture and sizing. Prepare a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate. Sizing questions regarding the AWS ROM are available in the [Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA)](https://mra-proserve.amazonaws.com/) tool under “Optional – Mainframe” – “Mainframe ROM Sizing Estimate” section. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
A ROM cost estimate that includes the following:

1) Infrastructure cost during migration
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Infrastructure cost after go-live
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Migration (labor)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Project duration
# Module: Portfolio Discovery and Analysis
## Task 1: Rapid portfolio determination
#### Description
Discover existing mainframe workloads that will be migrated. This discovery helps in the creation of a directional business case. Deeper discovery is part of the Mobilize phase.

Mainframe migrations can be done using two different strategies: 

1) Refactor
2) Re-platform


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Completed portfolio-discovery report
## Task 2: Pattern and tool guidance
#### Description
There is no one-size-fits all for mainframe modernization to AWS. Depending on the business and IT strategy and on the mainframe-specific technical constraints, select the most suitable pattern for migration. If the mainframe is large enough to process multiple workloads, each workload’s characteristics can favor different patterns.

For the identified portfolio, the patterns are the following: 

1) Short-term migration with automated refactoring
2) Short-term migration with middleware emulation
3) Augmentation with data analytics
4) Augmentation with new channels

For more information, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/yes-you-should-modernize-your-mainframe-with-the-cloud/).
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Identified pattern for mainframe migration to AWS
## Task 3: Source code analysis by relevant parties
#### Description
A source code analysis is performed for the Mainframe applications and databases as part of the migration to AWS. This will detect any vulnerabilities in the code and also help in strategize the direction of the overall migration. This must be done for few applications and databases which potentially would be part of the mainframe migration Proof of Concept (POC). 


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Completed source code analysis for applications to be migrated. 
# Module: Proof of Concept POC
## Task 1: POC Scope and Acceptance criteria
#### Description
In this task you complete the initial portfolio determination and gain knowledge on various Mainframe migration patterns and tools, then you identify some applications that can be migrated to AWS using various AWS tools. Complete the following steps as part of a high level plan for POC:

1) Define the scope of the POC by selecting some mainframe workloads to be migrated to AWS
2) List of Mainframe workloads to be migrated as part of the POC
3) The migration pattern to use for the POC
4) The resources needed for the POC
5) Milestones and timelines
6) Acceptance criteria for the POC



#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Defined scope for the mainframe migration POC
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ List of Mainframe workloads to be migrated as part of the POC
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ High-level migration plan for the POC
