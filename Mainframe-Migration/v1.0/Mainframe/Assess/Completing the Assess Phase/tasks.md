# Module: Mainframe Migration Pre kickoff
## Task 1: Informal conversation
#### Description
Migrating mainframe applications to AWS requires an approach with four phases: Assess, Mobilize, Migrate & Modernize, and Operate, Optimize & Innovate. It is important to get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase.

For an overview of the phases of a migration and the tools to use, see [AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html).
For an overview of the cloud migration process, see [cloud migration process](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/).
For an overview of the cloud migration process for mainframe workloads, see the [AWS Mainframe Modernization User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/what-is-m2.html).

# Module: Portfolio Discovery and Analysis
## Task 1: Rapid portfolio determination
#### Description
Discover existing mainframe workloads that will be migrated. This discovery helps in the creation of a directional business case. Deeper discovery is part of the Mobilize phase.

Mainframe migrations can be done using two different strategies: 

1) Refactor
2) Re-platform


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Completed portfolio-discovery report
## Task 2: Pattern and tool guidance
#### Description
There is no one-size-fits all for mainframe modernization to AWS. Depending on the business and IT strategy and on the mainframe-specific technical constraints, select the most suitable pattern for migration. If the mainframe is large enough to process multiple workloads, each workload’s characteristics can favor different patterns.

For the identified portfolio, the patterns are the following: 

1) Short-term migration with automated refactoring
2) Short-term migration with middleware emulation
3) Augmentation with data analytics
4) Augmentation with new channels

For more information, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/yes-you-should-modernize-your-mainframe-with-the-cloud/).
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Identified pattern for mainframe migration to AWS
## Task 3: Source code analysis by relevant parties
#### Description
A source code analysis is performed for the Mainframe applications and databases as part of the migration to AWS. This will detect any vulnerabilities in the code and also help in strategize the direction of the overall migration. This must be done for few applications and databases which potentially would be part of the mainframe migration Proof of Concept (POC). 


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Completed source code analysis for applications to be migrated. 
# Module: Proof of Concept POC
## Task 1: POC Scope and Acceptance criteria
