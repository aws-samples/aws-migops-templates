# Module: Mainframe Migration Pre kickoff
## Task 1: Informal conversation
#### Description
Migrating mainframe applications to AWS requires an approach with four phases: Assess, Mobilize, Migrate & Modernize, and Operate, Optimize & Innovate. It is important to get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase.

For an overview of the phases of a migration and the tools to use, see [AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html).
For an overview of the cloud migration process, see [cloud migration process](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/).
For an overview of the cloud migration process for mainframe workloads, see the [AWS Mainframe Modernization User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/what-is-m2.html).


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Learned about the four phases of a mainframe migration.
â€¢ Reviewed the list of AWS tools that are required in each phase of the migration.
## Task 2: Opportunity Qualification
#### Description
This task is for customers and partners to discuss the opportunity for modernization of mainframe workloads. Discuss the following topics: 

1) Mainframe agility in an on-premise environment
2) High costs associated with mainframes minimize innovation and experimentation
3) The flexibility of business processes and data is restricted
4) Finding experienced Mainframes specialists is challenging 

Discuss the benefits of Mainframe modernization in AWS: 

1) Increased agility
2) Cost savings
3) Improved innovation
4) Enhanced security
5) Scalability and elasticity 


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Documented the challenges of current on-premise mainframe workloads
2) Documented the benefits of mainframe modernization in AWS
## Task 3: First call presentation
#### Description
Prepare a first-call deck where you outline the best solutions and services that AWS provides for migrations. Present the deck to the relevant customer stakeholders. 

In the deck, address the following requirements, which are necessary for a successful migration: 

1) Planning for application portfolio
2) Building an operating model and service management framework
3) Using an experienced AWS partner for mainframe migrations
4) Introducing the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) for mainframe migrations


#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ A presentation with the best solutions and services that AWS provides for mainframe migrations
## Task 4: Rough Order of Magnitude Estimate
#### Description
In this task you estimate the current mainframe resource consumption and map it to an AWS target architecture and sizing. Prepare a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate. Sizing questions regarding the AWS ROM are available in the [Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA)](https://mra-proserve.amazonaws.com/) tool under “Optional – Mainframe” – “Mainframe ROM Sizing Estimate” section. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
A ROM cost estimate that includes the following:

1) Infrastructure cost during migration
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Infrastructure cost after go-live
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Migration (labor)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Project duration
