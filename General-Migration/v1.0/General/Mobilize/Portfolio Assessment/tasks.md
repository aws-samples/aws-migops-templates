## Task 2: Subtask 1: Plan Portfolio  Discovery Party
#### Description
The primary goals of the discovery party are to level up on the discovery process, identify the addressable scope, introduce an initial application prioritization criteria, and install, configure, and test the discovery tooling (if applicable), including rolling out data collection. To do so, it is necessary that the sources of data be clearly identified. Also, it is key that the requirements for tooling deployment, as well as the technical particularities of the environment where the tool will be deployed, be considered in advance. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Document a detailed plan to perform migrating environment discovery including the scope, prioritization, configuration, and data collection
## Task 2: Subtask 2: Document Portfolio Business Drivers
#### Description
To validate whether the outcomes have been achieved, link business drivers to a metric that can be measured throughout the migration journey. The company’s strategic goals and annual reports can act as a starting point. Focus the conversation on where the company wants to be, based on existent and projected metrics, as a result of moving to the cloud. Consider goals and business outcomes. Also, consider what success looks like as cloud adoption increases.  Next, establish the importance level of each driver. What are the priorities? What are the expected benefits? How do the benefits support the business goals and outcomes? In the context of application portfolio assessment, this will help to assist workload prioritization for migration and to establish technical guiding principles. However, business drivers will define and impact the migration program as a whole.  

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Artifact---Business-Drivers-and-Technical-Guiding-Principles.md)

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Document migrating environment business drivers such as Accelerate innovation, Reduce operational and infrastructure costs, and Increase operational resiliency
## Task 2: Subtask 3: Review Application Infrastructure Attributes  and Data Requirements
#### Description
Capturing application and infrastructure metadata (regardless of the source) is an iterative approach. It can take several weeks to obtain the desired level of detail. The recommendation is to focus on the data that can be obtained now and to keep enriching the data set as more data become available. A full inventory list includes tooling, assessment process, prioritization, migration strategy, and wave planning. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Template---Application-and-Infrastructure-Inventory.md)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Capture complete application and infrastructure metadata
## Task 2: Subtask 4: Identify Addressable Application/Infrastructure  Scope
#### Description
To perform the preliminary analysis, it is essential to understand which systems are in scope for discovery. Likewise, when discovery tooling is being used, it is essential to understand which systems will be targeted for data collection.
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Document complete list of systems which will be part of the data  collection
## Task 2: Subtask 5: Establish Default Application Prioritization  Criteria
#### Description
The objective of application prioritization is to select the application attributes (typically 2 to 10) that will be used to establish the order in which the applications will be moved to AWS, and to then assign a corresponding score or weighting to the possible values of those attributes. Next, you define the importance level of each attribute for prioritization. For example, if two attributes are being considered, the first step is to define the score for each possible value for those attributes. The next step will be to establish one of the attributes to have more importance or relevance for the prioritization of applications. The result of prioritization will be a ranking of applications. If the scoring is correct, the top 20 applications will be good candidates to select from for the initial migration and will be aligned to the desired criteria. If the outcome is not agreed upon, adjust the criteria and recreate the list. It takes several iterations to obtain baselined criteria. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Artifact---Application-Prioritization-Criteria.md)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Create a prioritized list of applications to migrate 
## Task 2: Subtask 6: Create Discovery Tooling roll-out plan
#### Description
It is unlikely that the discovery tool will be collecting data from all targeted systems by the end of the discovery party. Likewise, if a discovery tool is not being used, data collection will typically require more time and manual effort.  In general, data collection (and agent install, if required) will follow a progressive approach throughout several days or weeks. Clarify these aspects and plan for the rollout accordingly.  Data collection is a key input for the upcoming portfolio analysis party and it is recommended to obtain at least 1 or 2 weeks of discovery data from all targeted systems before conducting a data analysis. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Template---Application-and-Infrastructure-Inventory.md)
#### Acceptance Criteria

â€¢ Work with the relevant teams to gather application metadata
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Use the MPA tool to gather additional metadata
## Task 3: Subtask 3: Perform manual discovery workshops and activities if applicable
#### Description
In most environments there are cases where the discovery tool of choice doesn’t support a given legacy system. Examples include old operating system versions and legacy platforms such as AS400 or Mainframe.  If these systems are in scope for migration, recommend and perform manual discovery. This might require connecting to those systems directly, or the use of scripts that can be obtained from the discovery tooling vendor or platform teams or by specialized AWS practices. Conduct manual discovery workshops when necessary.

1) Prioritizing a subset of applications targeted for migration
2) Performing a detailed discovery
3) Conducting an AWS design session
4) Creating a draft migration strategy The party facilitates the identification of specific requirements and blockers for detailed application assessment, application design, and migration strategy for the in-scope applications, and resolves them. 

The duration of the party depends on the number of applications to be assessed and their complexity. The base estimate is of one day per application; the recommendations is to work with a maximum of 3 applications per party for a maximum duration of three days. However, this can change based on application complexity and customer needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Prioritized  list of subset applications which are to be migrated to AWS. 
## Task 5: Subtask 2: Confirm Prioritized Applications
#### Description
The goal of this session is to establish which key attributes will determine the selection of applications for the party.
