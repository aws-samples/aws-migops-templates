# Module: Migration Readiness Assessment
## Task 1: MRA -  Review objectives and best practices
#### Description
Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) is a critical step early in the migration journey. Its goal is to assess the readiness of your applications for migrating to AWS. You gain critical  insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the identified gaps. 

The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand their adoption into the AWS Cloud.

As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives might include building an overall vision, creating a reliable implementation roadmap, identifying gaps, and providing corrective actions.

In this module, you review the current architecture, security, and governance. You also create concrete deliverables to prepare for cloud adoption. By validating migration readiness against the available best practices, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture and avoid possible roadblocks while migrating.

For more information about MRA, see [Migration Readiness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-readiness/welcome.html.)

## Task 2: Subtask 1: Plan Portfolio  Discovery Party
#### Description
The primary goals of the discovery party are to level up on the discovery process, identify the addressable scope, introduce an initial application prioritization criteria, and install, configure, and test the discovery tooling (if applicable), including rolling out data collection. To do so, it is necessary that the sources of data be clearly identified. Also, it is key that the requirements for tooling deployment, as well as the technical particularities of the environment where the tool will be deployed, be considered in advance. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/tree/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Document a detailed plan to perform migrating environment discovery including the scope, prioritization, configuration, and data collection
## Task 2: Subtask 2: Document Portfolio Business Drivers
#### Description
To validate whether the outcomes have been achieved, link business drivers to a metric that can be measured throughout the migration journey. The company’s strategic goals and annual reports can act as a starting point. Focus the conversation on where the company wants to be, based on existent and projected metrics, as a result of moving to the cloud. Consider goals and business outcomes. Also, consider what success looks like as cloud adoption increases.  Next, establish the importance level of each driver. What are the priorities? What are the expected benefits? How do the benefits support the business goals and outcomes? In the context of application portfolio assessment, this will help to assist workload prioritization for migration and to establish technical guiding principles. However, business drivers will define and impact the migration program as a whole.  

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Artifact---Business-Drivers-and-Technical-Guiding-Principles.md)

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢ Document migrating environment business drivers such as Accelerate innovation, Reduce operational and infrastructure costs, and Increase operational resiliency
## Task 2: Subtask 3: Review Application Infrastructure Attributes  and Data Requirements
#### Description
Capturing application and infrastructure metadata (regardless of the source) is an iterative approach. It can take several weeks to obtain the desired level of detail. The recommendation is to focus on the data that can be obtained now and to keep enriching the data set as more data become available. A full inventory list includes tooling, assessment process, prioritization, migration strategy, and wave planning. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Template---Application-and-Infrastructure-Inventory.md)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Capture complete application and infrastructure metadata
## Task 2: Subtask 4: Identify Addressable Application/Infrastructure  Scope
#### Description

#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Document complete list of systems which will be part of the data  collection
## Task 2: Subtask 5: Establish Default Application Prioritization  Criteria
#### Description
The objective of application prioritization is to select the application attributes (typically 2 to 10) that will be used to establish the order in which the applications will be moved to AWS, and to then assign a corresponding score or weighting to the possible values of those attributes. Next, you define the importance level of each attribute for prioritization. For example, if two attributes are being considered, the first step is to define the score for each possible value for those attributes. The next step will be to establish one of the attributes to have more importance or relevance for the prioritization of applications. The result of prioritization will be a ranking of applications. If the scoring is correct, the top 20 applications will be good candidates to select from for the initial migration and will be aligned to the desired criteria. If the outcome is not agreed upon, adjust the criteria and recreate the list. It takes several iterations to obtain baselined criteria. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Artifact---Application-Prioritization-Criteria.md)
#### Acceptance Criteria
â€¢  Create a prioritized list of applications to migrate 
## Task 2: Subtask 6: Create Discovery Tooling roll-out plan
#### Description
It is unlikely that the discovery tool will be collecting data from all targeted systems by the end of the discovery party. Likewise, if a discovery tool is not being used, data collection will typically require more time and manual effort.  In general, data collection (and agent install, if required) will follow a progressive approach throughout several days or weeks. Clarify these aspects and plan for the rollout accordingly.  Data collection is a key input for the upcoming portfolio analysis party and it is recommended to obtain at least 1 or 2 weeks of discovery data from all targeted systems before conducting a data analysis. 

For more information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/General-Migration/v1.0/Portfolio/PortfolioAssessment/1-Portfolio-Discovery-and-Initial-Planning/Template---Application-and-Infrastructure-Inventory.md)
