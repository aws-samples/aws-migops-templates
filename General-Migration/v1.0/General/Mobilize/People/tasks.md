Change acceleration and the process design or business operations teams must consider the change impact areas (for example, skills, process, performance management, technology) of the change, and then consider all the potentially impacted stakeholder groups for each change impact area by process function. 

2) Conduct a stakeholder-based assessment. From all the stakeholder groups identified in the change impact assessment, and with the stakeholders identified in the stakeholder identification and analysis, conduct the gap analysis and impact assessment from the perspective of the stakeholder: How will they be impacted and what will their reactions and responses be?
