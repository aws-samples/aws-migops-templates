# Module: Initial Engagement with AWS
## Task 1: Get an overview of the AWS migration methodology
#### Description
To migrate applications to AWS, we recommend that you use an approach that consists of four phases: assessment, mobilization, migration, and operation. Before you start a migration, get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase. These details help simplify and automate the entire migration experience. 

For an overview of the phases and tools that we recommend you use for migrations, see [AWS Migration Hub.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html.)

For an overview of the migration process, see [AWS Cloud Migration.](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/.)

## Task 2: Document migration goals
#### Description
Document the type of applications that you want to migrate. Determine the main concerns that you need to address and the outcomes that you want to achieve by migrating to AWS. Example outcomes are cost savings and increased IT productivity. 

The questions and solutions that you document during the discussion help determine the overall direction for the migration.
