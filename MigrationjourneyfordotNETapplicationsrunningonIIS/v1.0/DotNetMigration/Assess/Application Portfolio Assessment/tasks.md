#### Tools
AWS Modernization Calculator
#### Tools
AWS Pricing Calculator
#### Acceptance Criteria
Understood cost estimates for workloads in AWS
## Task 1: Subtask 1: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to understand the cost of hosting .NET applications
#### Description
AWS Pricing Calculator is a web-based planning tool that you can use to create estimates for your AWS use cases. You can use it to model your solutions before building them, explore the AWS service price points, and review the calculations behind your estimates. You can use it to help you plan how you spend, find cost saving opportunities, and make informed decisions when using Amazon Web Services. AWS Pricing Calculator is useful for those who have never used AWS. It's also useful for those who want to reorganize or expand their AWS usage. You don't need any experience with the cloud or AWS to use AWS Pricing Calculator. AWS Pricing Calculator is available through a web-based console at https://calculator.aws/#/ .
#### Tools
AWS Pricing Calculator
#### Acceptance Criteria
Understood costs for rehosting applications on AWS
## Task 1: Subtask 2: Use AWS Modernization Calculator for Microsoft Workloads to estimate the cost of modernizing .NET applications
#### Description
AWS Modernization Calculator is an interactive tool that intuitively estimates the cost of running modernized workloads on AWS. You can use this calculator without detailed knowledge of AWS services and can receive guidance on the modernization approach that will work best for your Microsoft workloads. With a few clicks, you can receive new architecture patterns such as multi-tier, batch processing, and application containerization based on AWS Well-Architected Framework.
#### Tools
AWS Modernization Calculator
#### Tools
Generating Microsoft workload estimates with AWS Modernization Calculator
#### Acceptance Criteria
Understood cost estimates for Modernizing workloads on AWS
## Task 2: Use AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations for application portfolio analysis
#### Description
Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations helps you plan migration and modernization initiatives by offering migration and modernization strategy recommendations for viable transformation paths for your applications.
Strategy Recommendations can analyze your server inventory, runtime environment, and application binaries for Microsoft IIS and Java Tomcat and Jboss applications to generate anti-pattern reports. In addition, you can configure your source code to allow Strategy Recommendations to perform source code and database analysis of all of your applications. Strategy Recommendations compares this analysis with your business goals, and the transformation preferences of the applications and databases that you provided to recommend:
The most effective migration strategy for each of your applications. Migration and modernization tools or programs that you can use. Application incompatibilities and anti-patterns to resolve for a specific option.
#### Tools
Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations
#### Acceptance Criteria
Understood application migration/modernization strategy
## Task 2: Subtask 1: Setup Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations to collect details of the environment
#### Description
