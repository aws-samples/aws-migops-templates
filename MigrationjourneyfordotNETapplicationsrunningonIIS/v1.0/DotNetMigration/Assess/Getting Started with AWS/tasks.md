# Module: Getting Started with AWS
## Task 1: Get an Overview of AWS Migration Methodology
#### Description
To migrate applications to AWS, we recommend you to use an approach that consists of four phases: Assessment, Mobilization, Migration, and Operation. Before you start Migration, get an overview of these phases and the AWS tools to leverage in each phase. These details help simplify and automate entire experience.
For an overview of the phases and tools that we recommend you to use for migrations, see [AWS Migration Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html).
For an overview of the migration process, see [AWS Cloud Migration](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/).

## Task 1: Subtask 1: Learn more about AWS Migration Hub
#### Description
AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration. The Migration Hub provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking. You can visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating, regardless of which migration tool you are using.

Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to first discover servers and then group them into applications. Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub.
