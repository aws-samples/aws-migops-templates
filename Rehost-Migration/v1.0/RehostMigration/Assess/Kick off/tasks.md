# Module: Kick off
## Task 1: Get an overview of the AWS migration methodology
#### Description
To migrate applications to AWS using Rehost migration, we recommend that you use an approach that consists of 3 phases: assessment, mobilization and migration. Before you start a migration, get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase. These details help simplify and automate the entire migration experience. 

For an overview of the phases and tools that we recommend you use for migrations, see [AWS Migration Hub.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html)
