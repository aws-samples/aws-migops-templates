# Module: Database optimization
## Task 1: Plan and implement database optimization 
#### Description
In the Operate and Optimize phase, you can maximize the benefits derived from hosting applications in AWS. The optimizing activities can address 

1)	Cost
2)	Performance
3)	Security 
4)	Resiliency concerns 

One of the optimization features is automatic scaling to add more read replicas during peak hours and remove them during off-peak hours to lower costs. Setting up databases to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for analysis also helps with optimization.
#### Tools
AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) 
#### Tools
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
#### Acceptance Criteria
