# Module: Database Migration Discovery
## Task 1: Perform a deep dive into the database that you want to migrate
#### Description
The database migration discovery is an important phase where the team does a deep dive into the database that needs to be migrated. During the discovery phase key aspects of the database such as database configuration, HA/DR implementation, schema objects, usage of proprietary features, dependencies with other databases and applications, associated ETLs or data pipelines, replication, and topography, are identified and documented.

A deep dive is conducted where the customer team who owns that database walks through the database structure, schema, and all its associated dependencies. During this time, the AWS team also walks through DB Discovery Questionnaire with the customer team to get more information on the database. The AWS team or the customer database SME must run the AWS Schema Conversion Tool for a deep-dive database assessment for migration.

For more information, see [DB Migration Questionnaire](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/HeterogeneousDatabase-Migration/v1.0/DatabaseMigration/.attachments/DatabaseMigration/Database%20Migration%20Questionnaire.xlsx).

2) Based on SCT reports, review object counts and estimate the size of the data store to be migrated and the effort required for code conversion and unit testing
3) Identify schema objects or proprietary database features that cannot be automatically converted
4) Create a plan for migrating the database, including workarounds for any incompatibilities between the source database and the target database engines 
5) Understand the technological complexities 
6) Map database-to-application dependencies (which apps access the database)
7) Map database-to-ETL-job dependencies (which ETL jobs intput/output data from the database)
8) Map database-to-database dependencies (usage of database links, linked servers, etc.)

Consolidate this data into an estimation template.
