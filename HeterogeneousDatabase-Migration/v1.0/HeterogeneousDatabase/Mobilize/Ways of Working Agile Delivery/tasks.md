# Module: Ways of Working Agile Delivery
## Task 1: Create an engagement and execution plan
#### Description
Use the PowerPoint template in GitHub to prepare a presentation. Meet with workstream leads and spend time reviewing next steps, and assign appropriate owners. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure that workstream leads acknowledge the plan and that they start putting together backlogs for their areas in the next set of tasks. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog. 
## Task 2: Create a task roadmap
#### Description
Use the task roadmap template in GitHub to create tasks for workstream owners to create their respective backlogs. The template in GitHub spans multiple work streams. Add additional workstreams as needed. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensured that tasks per work stream were created in this phase. Ensured that all tasks have owners assigned by the workstream lead. 
## Task 3: Create subtasks roadmap
#### Description
Use the subtasks roadmap template in GitHub to create subtasks for workstream owners to create their respective backlogs. The template in GitHub spans multiple work streams. Add additional work streams as needed. Create new MigOps tasks from the relevant backlog. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensured that subtasks were created in this phase. Ensured that all tasks have owners assigned by the workstream lead. 
## Task 4: Plan sprints and execute
#### Description
Ensure that each task and subtask are scheduled to be carried out in a future sprint. All task assignees must update the start date and end date for each task based on planning. As tasks are carried out, workstream owners can choose to double-check the acceptance criteria for each task and confirm completion. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Ensured that the timelines for performing tasks and subtasks are recorded. Ensure that all workstream leads keep up with timelines and discuss any risks. 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Assign due dates to all tasks and subtasks according to the sprint plan.
