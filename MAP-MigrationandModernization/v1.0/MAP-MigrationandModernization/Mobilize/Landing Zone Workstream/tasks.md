*  Compliance : Internal, external and industry specific.
*  Cloud platform operations and automation.
*  Platform security : covering account activity traceability, policy enforcement, guardrails, configuration management, notification, segregation, monitoring and logging.
*  Centralized identity and access management
*  Landing Zone deployment methodology

3. Leverage the [AWS Landing Zone Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-aws-environment/welcome.html), [Mobilization Prescriptive Guidance ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-migration/aws-landing-zone.html) and [AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html) for best practice on landing zone design areas.

4. Document the landing zone design as part of the cloud implementation/design documentation. You can leverage this [guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/document-your-aws-landing-zone-design.html) to ease documentations.

5. Document the landing zone platform operations as part of the cloud operations runbook.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Completion of the AWS Landing Zone design areas leveraging AWS Best Practices.

## Task 1: Subtask 3: Landing Zone Deployment
#### Description
1. Select the AWS Landing Zone deployment methodology based on the below criteria :-
*  Customization requirements complexity
*  Security and compliance requirements 
*  AWS services availability
*  Post implementation management 

2. Common AWS Landing Zone deployment methodology are as below :- 
* [AWS Control Tower ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html)
* [AMS Multi-Account Landing Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/userguide/malz-net-arch-accounts.html) 
* [Landing Zone Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/)
* Custom Landing Zone 
* [AWS Marketplace Landing Zone Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=landing+zone)

3. Deploy the AWS Landing Zone based on the selected deployment methodology.
  
4. Configure and add customisation to the deployed Landing Zone to meet design requirements. Configurations are mainly at the AWS service level and can be customized depending on the selected Landing Zone methodology example through [AWS Account Factory Customization ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/af-customization-page.html) and [Customization for AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/cfct-overview.html).
