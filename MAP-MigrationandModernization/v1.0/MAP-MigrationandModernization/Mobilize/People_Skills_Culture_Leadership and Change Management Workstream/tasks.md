## Task 4: Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) Definition and Build
#### Description
1. Discover if there is an existing Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) to manage the governance of cloud adoption, migration and operations. You can leverage the Cloud Readiness Assessment or AWS Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) to assess this requirement.

2. Evaluate if the existing Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is built following AWS CCoE best practices. If the current Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is not following AWS best practice or there is no Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) defined leverage the [AWS Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) prescriptive guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-center-of-excellence/introduction.html) to define, implement and enforce the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).

3. Ensure when defining the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) the below areas are well defined and aligned across all stakeholders :- 
* Tenets
* KPI
* Functions

4. Leverage the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) phases to envision, align, launch and scale the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).

5. Ensure the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is led by a single threaded leader to ensure ownership and accelerated decision making.

	*Note : Building Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is an optional task . However, it is highly recommended as it help accelerate cloud adoption, migration and operation governance.*
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Successful update or implementation of the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).
2. Successful enforcement of the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).
