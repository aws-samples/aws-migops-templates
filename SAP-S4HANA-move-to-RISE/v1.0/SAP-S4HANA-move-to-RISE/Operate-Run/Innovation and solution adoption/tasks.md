## Task 1: Identify Innovation & Growth Opportunities
#### Description
The CSP will support the customer post go-live towards the intelligent enterprise.The CSP will do this by utilising the Outcome Success Plan (OSP). The OSP will have documented the key deficient dimensions the customer wished to improve as a result of the RA. These key focus areas form a framework to track activities that are jointly agreed to execute on to help the customer achieve greater business benefits from their investment in SAP. As part of this framework, SuccessPlays will have been selected to address closing the gap between the customers current status and their goal status for each identified deficient dimension. E.g. If the customer has a call center and a relevant business KPI is ticket resolution rates, the OSP would track activities that could potentially improve that KPI via SAP software capabilities.Please see the useful links for more information on the RA & OSP.

## Task 2: Benefits realisation
#### Description
Review previous recommendations to determine if the benefits have been realized and what further opportunities should be fed back into the continuous learning phase.

## Task 3: ISV Spotlight: Ktern.AI
#### Description
Leverage KTern.AI data-driven analysis of SAP S/4HANA systems and determine the indicative to-be S/4HANA process hierarchy (L1 - LoB, L2 - Process group, L3 - Scope item, L4 - Scope item variant, L5 - Process step) with respective benefits, process model, Fiori apps, relevancy score & top business users based on AS-IS usage. Take advantage of clean core insights from KTern.AI to understand on how to redefine the process with industry standard scope items with a clean core transition approach.

Leverage KTern.AI autonomous enterprise release impact mining to drive continuous SAP S/4HANA releases with complete visibility on process, technical changes with usage, root cause, top impacted users and orchestrate controlled, risk-aware releases. Connect to the DevOps tools, understand the right testing portfolio, drive intelligent regression and run proactive test scoping. This helps reduce business disruptions with digitalized simulation of release impact with test fits and gaps, leading to streamlined OCM and faster DevOps.
