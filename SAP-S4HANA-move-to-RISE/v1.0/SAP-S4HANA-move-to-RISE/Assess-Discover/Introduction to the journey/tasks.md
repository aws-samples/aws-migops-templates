## Task 1: S/4HANA upgrade considerations
#### Description
As long as you are in an SAP S/4HANA version that is (and will be for at least one year) under mainstream maintenance, you can perform a lift and shift to move to RISE.
 
For SAP S/4 HANA versions < 1909, it is recommended to upgrade to at least S/4HANA 1909.

SAP Readiness Check is a must if you are planning to upgrade your system as part of your move. 

In case of a lift and shift migration without version updates, it is not mandatory but recommended.
