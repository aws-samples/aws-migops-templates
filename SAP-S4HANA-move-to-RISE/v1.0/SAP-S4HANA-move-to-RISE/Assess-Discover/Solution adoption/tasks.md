## Task 1: Stakeholder Identification
#### Description
As part of the project governance, perform Stakeholder mapping; mapping the decision authority and detailing the various communication and information needs for each stakeholder. Once all key Customer stakeholders have been identified and mapped, ensure that they are all included in the governance model and that all necessary cadences are implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria
• Determine  the AWS Personnel and Customer stakeholder to perform the Mobilize phase  tasks. 
## Task 2: Cloud Mindset Assessment
#### Description
Assess user adoption risk levels and review recommendations for risk mitigation. Assess organizational readiness for the cloud subscription business model and use the results to suggest action plans proportionate with the identified risk level. The plans should be used for organisational change management (OCM) related topics, to ensure sustained business success.Note: Engage with SAP or the implementation partner prior to starting a project to assess OCM initiatives.Procedure: Learn the OCM Customer Readiness Whitepaper useful link.Watch the Cloud Mindset Video useful link.Read the Cloud Mindset Now Blog useful link.Review, distribute, and complete the Cloud Mindset Assessment useful link(s). Review risk level determination value and recommendation for action.

## Task 3: ISV Spotlight: Ktern.AI
#### Description
KTern.AI can be leveraged across various stages of the assessment and solution adoption phase: 
1. KTern.AI Digital automation wizard and prepare the matrix of adoption checklist with multi-level approvals from customer, partner, SAP to digitalize and drive the end-to-end execution with workflow automation and streamlined change management. This helps to redefine the traditional adoption methods and realize the value of effective RISE adoption with disciplined execution.
2. KTern.AI data-driven scan of SAP ERP systems to perform application value and scoping -
* (a) Understand the extensiveness and complexity of as-is enterprise operations across different org entities based on master, customizing, transactional data analysis to help in workshops, testing. 
* (b) Understand as-is usage of standard, custom, third party addon based process steps, modules with nature of execution (batch/dialog/RFC etc) and top business users identified for business workshops, change management, UAT.
* (c) Determine the indicative to-be S/4HANA process hierarchy (L1 - LoB, L2 - Process group, L3 - Scope item, L4 - Scope item variant, L5 - Process step) with respective benefits, process model, Fiori apps, relevancy score & top business users based on AS-IS usage. The IT Architects and Consultants can leverage these results and drive workshops with business users to refine and finalize the process catalog for S/4HANA transformation 
* (d) Determine the as-is process steps, users, custom objects, interfaces
* (e) Determine the to-be custom code impact, scope items, test scenarios, timeline and effort estimate
* (f) Determine the TO-BE S/4HANA transition timeline and effort, based on assessment of complexity parameters and data-driven profiling of process, custom objects, landscape and business transformation
* (g) Gain insights on test scenarios with org data variants to help in the functional testing across different lines of business

2) Digital captures of meeting moments that includes Call to Actions (CTAs), information, summary, agenda, conversations

3) Interlinks to project execution with work item references and process scope items for streamlined RISE adoption
Leverage KTern.AI data-driven scan of SAP ERP systems to assess the user activity in standard and customized business process across different LoBs. This would help to identify and map the key users for workshops, UAT and change management
