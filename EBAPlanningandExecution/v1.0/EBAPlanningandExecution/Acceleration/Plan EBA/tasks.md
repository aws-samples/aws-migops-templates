# Module: Plan EBA
## Task 1: Finalize Scope And Select Applications
#### Description
1. Identify 5-10 candidate applications for the EBA with the goal of shortlisting 3-5 medium complexity application eventually. If the customer already has a migration plan in place, this step becomes a review of the selected applications to ensure alignment amongst stakeholders.

2. Application Selection Guidance - Selected applications should:
*  Represent the application landscape that is in the migration program or scope
*  Be of “Medium-level” complexity
*  Have a defined business value that can be validated post-migration (ie. cost/agility/UX)
*  Have established or documented acceptance testing criteria
*  Have the application owner on board and application SMEs available to participate in the EBA

3. If required, conduct portfolio assessment/application discovery (see [wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS/Teams/Proserve/Migration/PortfolioAssessment)) to identify and prioritize the applications for EBA

* **EBA leads** - Daily standups or at least 2-3 times per week to monitor progress
* **WS Leads** - 3x/week or as needed to complete pre-work
* **Other** - SMEs and workstream leads should hold working sessions as needed to make progress leading up to the EBA
