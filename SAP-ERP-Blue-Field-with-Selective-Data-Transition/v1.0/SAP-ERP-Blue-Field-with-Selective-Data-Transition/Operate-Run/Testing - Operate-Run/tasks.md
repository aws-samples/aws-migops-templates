# Module: Testing - Operate-Run
## Task 1: Identify Innovation & Growth Opportunities
#### Description
The CSP will support the customer post go-live towards the intelligent enterprise.The CSP will do this by utilising the Outcome Success Plan (OSP). The OSP will have documented the key deficient dimensions the customer wished to improve as a result of the RA. These key focus areas form a framework to track activities that are jointly agreed to execute on to help the customer achieve greater business benefits from their investment in SAP. As part of this framework, SuccessPlays will have been selected to address closing the gap between the customers current status and their goal status for each identified deficient dimension. E.g. If the customer has a call center and a relevant business KPI is ticket resolution rates, the OSP would track activities that could potentially improve that KPI via SAP software capabilities.Please see the useful links for more information on the RA & OSP.

## Task 2: Benefits realisation
#### Description
Review previous recommendations to determine if the benefits have been realized and what further opportunities should be fed back into the continuous learning phase.

## Task 3: ISV Partner Spotlight - Tricentis - Continuous change impact analysis
#### Description
Run continuous change impact analysis
Run release change impact analysis
Run S/4 upgrade analysis
S/4 featurepack analysis
Run continuous configuration checks
Continuous Testing
**Run continuous change impact analysis**
This task involves continuously running change impact analysis that will allow the team to continuously monitor changes for immediate detection of issues caused by recent code or environment changes, S/4 feature pack analysis, and configuration checks.

**Run release change impact analysis**
This task involves the continuous execution of impact analyses throughout the project to maintain high-quality software standards and ensure alignment with project requirements. By leveraging SAP Change Impact Analysis,  automates the detection and assessment of changes, allowing the team to address test coverage issues promptly and efficiently.

**Run S/4 upgrade analysis**
This task entails conducting continuous comprehensive analysis by using SAP Change Impact Analysis after the upgrade to SAP S/4HANA. The analysis will focus on identifying necessary changes in the IT infrastructure, assessing the compatibility of current business processes, and evaluating data migration strategies. This will help in mitigating risks associated with the upgrade and planning for a smooth transition.


**S/4 featurepack analysis**
This task involves the automated assessment of feature packs released for SAP S/4HANA, which may include updates, new functionalities, or enhancements to existing features. The project team will review these updates, test them in a controlled environment.

**Run continuous configuration checks**
Setting up an automated process to continuously monitor and verify system configurations against predefined benchmarks or standards. The team will implement checks that continuously audit the system configurations to detect and rectify any discrepancies that could lead to security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or functionality errors.

**Continuous Testing**
This ensures the continuous testing strategy that leverages SAP Application Testion Solutions to perform tests automatically and frequently throughout ongoing system changes. This approach allows for the early detection of defects, reduces manual testing efforts, and helps maintain a high standard of software quality from development to production.
