# Module: Application Design and Configuration - Prepare-Explore
## Task 1: Fit-to-Standard Preparation
#### Description
Prepare to deep dive into Fit-to-Standard Workshops to decide on business priorities, business areas, and other functionality to be implemented. Fit-to-Standard Workshops are organized around the business areas and show how the solution can meet the business requirements. They help enable business process experts on the identification and execution of pre-configured business processes. Delta requirements are identified during the workshops, the configuration is determined and catalogued as outputs of the fit-to-standard process and is used as inputs for the solution configuration process in Realize.Prerequisite:There is a sandbox system available.In system conversion projects, documentation from the old ERP solution is important. This might include process diagrams, regression test cases and scripts and the original WRICEF list.Training and pre-reading materials provided to workshop participants. Project team members have access to the SAP Best Practices and other relevant platform(s) needed for the workshops. Procedure:Review the number and sequence of Fit-to-Standard workshops that were defined in the project plan during Transition Planning activity in the Prepare phase.Schedule and Structure the Fit-to-Standard workshops. The Fit-to-Standard analysis workshops are defined and scheduled based on the customer's unique application scope. It is recommended to structure the workshops along Line of Business areas and respective business areas. The SAP S/4HANA Line of Business (LoBs) are structured as follows:Asset Management Finance Human Resources Manufacturing R&D / Engineering Sales Services Sourcing and Procurement Supply Chain Sustainability Structure Each LoB workshop into respective business areas. See the Prepare for Fit-to-Standard Workshops SAP Activate' link for examples.Prepare the Fit-to-Standard workshop materials, including SAP Best Practices content, the demonstrations, templates to document results, test scripts, process flows, slides to run the workshops, lists of questions and required decisions. Business process experts to execute the standard processes, in the allocated Fit-to-Standard system, demonstrated in the Fit-to-Standard workshops. Executing the standard processes will help enable the business process experts in using the new solution and solidify the key decisions made during the Fit-to-Standard workshops. Note(s):Navigate the SAP Signavio Process Navigator in the useful link section. Then use the scope ID to search for the desired standard business process that will be executed. Download the scope test script and process flow. Use the test script and provided data to execute the standard processes in the Fit-to-Standard system.Details on the scope items can be found using the Enterprise Management Layer for SAP S/4HANA useful link and follow the path provided: SAP Enterprise Management Layer for SAP S/4HANA  select Scope Item List' under the useful links' section.

## Task 2: Fit-to-Standard System Preparation
#### Description
Finalise the setup of the Fit-to-Standard System in order to prepare for the fit-to-standard activity. Before the Explore phase can begin, it is important to ensure that a functional system is available to be used for demonstration and visualization purposes during Fit-to-Standard workshops. The functional system (Fit-to-Standard system) will either be the sandbox system or a development system, depending on the customer's selection. This is an essential part of the overall implementation strategy as this is the foundation to start with a pre-configured solution already during the explore phase.The scope for the pre-configured content should be reconfirmed, based on the results out of the Discovery phase.For new implementations, the activation of the best-practice content is done before the system provisioning.For system conversions, the provisioning of the sandbox system is in scope. This is the baseline for exploring the solution functionality that has been included in scope and for confirming that the business needs are addressed.Customers who have selected theenterprise management layer for SAP S/4HANAwill have their system built based on their requirements. The enterprise management layer is a ready-to-run preconfigured service containing accelerators to help implement the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition solution faster and promote a higher Fit-to-Standard. Review theEnterprise Management Layer for SAP S/4HANA useful link for more information about what is available in the system.

## Task 3: Business Driven Configuration Assessment
#### Description
Provide preliminary configuration and further insight into the customer`s process based on the solution scope and the customer's current operational processes. This information is used in planning and executing thefit-to-standardworkshops (including maintenance of sample data to be used duringfit-to-standard).Procedure:<ol style=font-weight: 400;>Download theBusiness Driven Configuration Questionnaireuseful links that are applicable to the solution scope. Find these in the useful link link that leads to the Activate roadmap.Incorporate the findings in the planning of the fit-to-standard workshops.Note:<ul style=font-weight: 400;>TheBusiness Driven Configurationquestionsare categorized by levels:Level 2questions should be answered in thePrepare Phaseand are geared to collect information prior to running the fit-to-standard workshops. Level 3questions should be answered in theExplore Phaseduring the Fit-to-Standard workshops. Note,Level 1questions are asked during theDiscover Phase.For questions related to B2B integrations via EDI please refer to theBusiness Driven Configuration Questionnaire - Integrationuseful link.

## Task 7: Fit-to-Standard Execution
#### Description
The output of the SAP Signavio Process Discovery tool can be used to determine the impact of the Customer moving back to standard.After the customer fit-to-standard workshops, there will be solution configuration and delta requirements, etc. As a result of these workshop outputs and agreed changes, design documentation and business sign-off is required. The initial classification and documentation will be performed by the responsible lead for the respective area. Some delta requirements may be eliminated by adapting the business process to the standard solution. For example, an organizational change management issue identified in core Finance could be resolved by the business key user for Core Finance.Procedure:The following aspects should be classified and documented for each delta requirement:Short and long descriptionDelta requirement typeReason i.e. what would happen if this is not realizedNumbering logicPriority, e.g. by MoSCoWMust have (e.g. mandatory changes from simplification list)Should have (e.g. for the first month end closure)Could have: important but not mandatoryWould be nice to haveOwnershipAssignment to respective SAP Best Practice scope item or solution capabilityJudgement of initial complexityFor information on the types of delta requirements please see the Fit-To-Standard Workshop Documentation &ndash; SAP Activate useful link.Note: Any documentation not captured during or after the fit-to-standard workshops should be added in the Requirements and Notes view of SAP Cloud ALM, in the Backlog (tool or template).
