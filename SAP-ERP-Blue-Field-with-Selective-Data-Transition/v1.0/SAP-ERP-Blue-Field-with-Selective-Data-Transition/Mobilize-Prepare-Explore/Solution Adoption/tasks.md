## Task 6: Set up the Operational Change ManagementÂ  team
#### Description
Set up the OCM team and agree on an OCM concept (containing OCM network concept, stakeholder engagement concept, communication concept, organizational transition concept, learning concept, change effectiveness concept, and OCM sustainability concept) that defines a common understanding of OCM for the project in terms of what, why, how and who needs to address the change. Procedure:Set up an OCM team, define roles and responsibilities and agree on OCM approach/roadmap to ensure sponsorship. See Set Up the OCM Workstream useful link.Identify stakeholders and all employees affected by or able to influence the digital transformation (e.g. system user lists, organisational charts, etc.).Define the OCM network concept to include stakeholder engagement concept, communications concept, organisational transition concept, change effectiveness concept, and OCM sustainability concept. See the OCM Conceptsuseful link. In addition, refer to the Blog - Accelerate SAP Cloud Solution Adoption With New Templatesuseful link in the for virtual workshop templates, which include other assets to support conducting effective and efficient setup and concept workshops.

## Task 7: OCM Impact Analysis
#### Description
Analyse the impact of the operational change management (OCM). Ensure that the OCM and technical changes in business processes have been identified and documented by comparing the as-is and the to-be business processes.

## Task 8: Value Realisation

KTern.AI Project Control Centre to define the transformation mechanism with disciplined preparation using Communication Cadence Wizards, Risk Registers, Business Summary, Implementation Approach, Template Definitions, Organization Structure and Escalation Workflow Automation towards driving governance with complete digital footprint.

KTern.AI digital automation wizard and drive delivery transition with multi-level approvals from customer, partner, SAP to digitalize and drive the end-to-end execution with workflow automation and streamlined change management. Take advantage of instant approval workflows, configurable sign off reports, multi-level approvals with digital discussions, integrations with Docusign. This helps to redefine the traditional adoption methods and realize the value of effective RISE adoption with disciplined execution. Capture rule based automation to capture user stories and simulate the creation of workitems for scope items using configurable agile delivery templates. This drives RISE implementation and adoption in faster sprint cycles with digitalized PMO governance. KTern.AI digital automation wizards to save time and effort in organizing and driving the fit-to-standard workshops with turnkey wizards to capture the workshop moments including discussion points, Call To Action (CTA) with interlinks to project workitems. Prepare OCM matrix with multi-level approvals from customer, partner, SAP to digitalize and drive the end-to-end execution with workflow automation and streamlined change management.

KTern.AI agile delivery automation wizards using Clone and Create to orchestrate rapid creation of iterative project workitems for different scope items. Capture rule based automation to capture user stories and simulate the creation of workitems for scope items using configurable agile delivery templates. This drives RISE implementation and adoption in faster sprint cycles with digitalized PMO governance.

KTern.AI data-driven scan of SAP ERP systems to understand the existing business processes and suggest the standard SAP scope items that are more relevant to the business, inorder to drive fit-to-standard adaptation in RISE with SAP S/4HANA transition. KTern.AI data-driven scan of SAP ERP systems to understand the extensiveness and complexity of as-is enterprise operations across different org entities based on master, customizing, transactional data analysis to help in business configuration analysis. KTern.AI data-driven scan of SAP ERP systems to understand the clean core driven analysis of as-is custom codes with usage and determine the comprehensive to-be impact with prioritization of fixes based on level of impact and materiality.
