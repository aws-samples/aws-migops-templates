# Module: Data Management
## Task 1: Data Migration
#### Description
Legacy data migration. Develop, test, and execute the data migration programs and processes defined in the Explore phase. Perform iterative data migration and testing cycles focused on the analysis of data, refinement of business rules, and processes designed to move, cleanse, transform, and enrich legacy data required to support the various test cycles and ultimately the production cutover.Take advantage of data migration templates, perform the upload of data into the staging area of the migration tool, data validation, load simulation, data migration execution, and conduct a final data quality assessment.The Customer should validate and sign-off the migration.

## Task 2: AWS: Data migration tools and accelerators
#### Description
Evaluate AWS tools for data migration acceleration from SAP and non-SAP sources. The target maybe SAP Datasphere. 

## Task 3: Cutover Plan
#### Description
Cutover planning covers the cutover tasks required to achieve the Production Cutover with the desired quality, outcomes and timelines. Cutover Planning includes all aspects to execute a cutover. Including logistics, communications, key decision points, continuity and contingency planning and a detailed Cutover Project Plan.

## Task 4: Production Cutover
#### Description
Execute the cutover plan and ready the business and system for productive use. The cutover plan contains both business process tasks as well as system tasks.

Examples of tasks in the cutover list are as follows:
* Setting up and initializing the production system
* Setting up and verifying interface connections
* Migration or creation of master data via manual, data migration tool, and/or interfaced system
* Migration of order objects (i.e. purchase orders, sales orders)
* User creation
* Notification of impacted 3rd parties
* Go/no go decision points
* Closing the legacy systems
* Completing all required documentation for regulatory purposes
* Cutover to the productive system, obtain the customer approval (sign-off), validate that the go-live acceptance criteria have been met, and confirm the successful go-live.


Procedure:
* Execute the cutover to Production following the tasks defined in the cutover plan.
* Document the duration of each step to support future projects.
* Capture any variances to the plan along with the decision maker that approved the change.
## Task 5: ISV Spotlight: DMI
#### Description
Migration supported by JiVS IMP SAP S/4
Production Data Load supported by JiVS IMP Migration
Seamless access to historical data supported by JiVS IMP AS
Archiving historical data supported by JiVS IMP History
## Task 6: ISV Spotlight: Syniti
#### Description
Simple, Collaborative Data Enrichment. Create simple web forms to empower users to enrich and improve data. Construct new data, cleanse irrelevant/ bad data, and create fixes for potential transformation blockers (i.e. no country codes). THE SYNITI DIFFERENCE:

Low/No Code Web Forms
Track Enrichment Tasks By User
Back up/ Restore Capability
Optimized, Progressive Data Transformation. Run transformation rules created in ‘Design’ and begin the testing and rule refinement process. Analyze the results and iterate through agile data sprints to optimize data rule effectiveness. THE SYNITI DIFFERENCE:

Repeatable, Quick Process
Automated Code Generation
Full Compliance and Visibility for Managers
Reduce Risk with Proactive Simulation. Simulate a data migration release in a secure test environment. Analyze rule performance through pre-load reports to identify load challenges and introduce immediate fixes before the actual cutover. THE SYNITI DIFFERENCE:

Built-In Testing Environment
Automated Reports
Errors Eliminated Before Load
Swift, Efficient Data Loading. Your data preparation work pays off as simple, click and go mechanism initiates the transfer of your business- ready data to the target system. The SAP ADMM’s compatibility with leading ETL platform helps makes loading frictionless. THE SYNITI DIFFERENCE:

Integrates with Leading Load Tools
Compatible with SAP Migration Cockpit
25+ Years of Loading Experience
Business-Validated, Data Migration Review. Pull data back out of target system to compare actual load results vs. expected. Analyze the migration metrics, errors, and defects for a spot check, and reconcile any new issues with business users. THE SYNITI DIFFERENCE:

Pre-Defined Dashboards
Automated Issue Identification
Designed for Business Users
## Task 7: ISV Spotlight: SNP
#### Description
SNP has a full range of products and solutions that help you in big transformation, carve out or cloud move projects.
During Migrate/Deploy phase, SNP [CrystalBridge Transformation](https://www.snpgroup.com/en/platform/software-and-components/crystalbridge-transformation/) guides you through the steps from initial analysis to final [automated validation](https://www.snpgroup.com/en/solutions/data-management-transformation/automated-data-validation/). You are in control of your data that needs to be selectively moved  (or not moved) to new SAP S/4HANA. You  can decide the migration scope & approach,  whether you're going with a big bang or a wave approach. You can also choose to migrate at any time in the fiscal year, not just year end, taking the pressure off at an already busy time.
