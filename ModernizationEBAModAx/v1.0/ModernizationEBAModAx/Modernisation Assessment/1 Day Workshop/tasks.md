## Task 1: Application Modernization Assessment (MODA)
#### Description
Modernization evaluation is the process of putting together an assessment that helps determine the modernization readiness of an organization’s applications. Amazon Web Services (AWS) recommends using an application questionnaire in the assessment phase to evaluate and rationalize your organization’s application portfolio and determine the business, functional, technical, and financial significance of applications in the portfolio. This assessment determines how well your organization can support the future state architecture of these applications, after modernization.

## Task 3: North Star metrics
#### Description
Identify the Modernization goals and North Star metrics. North Star metrics will be used to measure and evaluate the modernization effort over time and align people around a common goal. An example of a North Star metric is 'Reduce cost to serve' or 'faster deployments'
## Task 4: Map the Stack
#### Description
Utilising Wardley Maps to *Map the Stack*. This is a way to look at the software stack and predict movement and inertia as software evolves and identfy the 'next best modernization action.

*The next best action has two key goals. The first is to do whatever we can to create an immediate impact and reduce friction for the team. The second is to introduce the team to the concept that there will be future changes that will not be attempted now—in essence, the next best action is the first of many next best actions to come. The next best action is not a “one and done” event. It’s the first move in a game of chess. Like in chess, it’s important to sequence out the steps that should lead to a checkmate. That’s where mapping your tech stack or solution comes in. Of course, there may be pivots and obstacles along the way, but the map will help the team navigate those obstacles together and remain focused on the goal.*
