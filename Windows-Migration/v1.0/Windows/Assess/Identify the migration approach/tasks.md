## Task 1: VM Import/Export
#### Description
[VM Import/Export](https://https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/how-vm-import-export-works.html) enables you to import virtual machine (VM) images from your existing virtualization environment to Amazon EC2, and then export them back. This enables you to migrate applications and workloads to Amazon EC2, copy your VM image catalog to Amazon EC2, or create a repository of VM images for backup and disaster recovery.
