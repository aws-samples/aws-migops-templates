# Module: Application optimization and Modernization
## Task 1: Assess  scope of application optimization or modernization
#### Description
The first step in a modernization journey is to analyze the existing application portfolio, carefully assess systems that need to be modernized, and build and carry out a technical solution for application modernization by using the right strategy 
1) Assess applications through five lenses:
a) Strategic or business fit
b) Functional adequacy
c) Technical adequacy
d) Financial fit
e) Digital readiness 
2) Group, rank, and sequence applications 
3) Document target and interim operating models 
4) Understand key technology and regulatory requirements
5) Determine applications that need extensive data migration  
6) Clarify the scope and volume of the data to be converted For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/assess.html)
#### Tools
Application modernization questionnaire
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document a  detailed optimization strategy or blueprint 
#### Acceptance Criteria
• Document the technical and functional tools required to achieve  optimization
## Task 2: Execute application optimization or modernization plan
#### Description
During  this phase, determine project goals and resource requirements, and build out  the implementation roadmap. The goal is to revitalize applications by using a  modernization program that creates a modern, agile application  architecture  
1) Determine the milestones for converting your applications’ source code  and data  
2) Complete the mapping of all operational areas to ensure that required  standards and procedures for operating  
3) Implement an infrastructure solution that can address all concerns in  the existing environmentFor more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/modernize.html)



#### Tools
AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces
