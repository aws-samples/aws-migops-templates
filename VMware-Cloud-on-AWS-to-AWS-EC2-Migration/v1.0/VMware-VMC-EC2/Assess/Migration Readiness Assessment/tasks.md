# Module: Migration Readiness Assessment
## Task 1: Schedule and perform MRA with AWS 
#### Description
Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) is a critical step early in the migration journey. Its goal is to assess the readiness of your applications for migrating to AWS. You gain critical insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the identified gaps. 

The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand their adoption into the AWS Cloud.

As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives might include building an overall vision, creating a reliable implementation roadmap, identifying gaps, and providing corrective actions.

In this module, you review the current architecture, security, and governance. You also create concrete deliverables to prepare for cloud adoption. By validating migration readiness against the available best practices, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture and avoid possible roadblocks while migrating.
