# Module: Engage with AWS
## Task 1: Get an overview of the AWS migration methodology from AWS
#### Description
To migrate applications to AWS, we recommend that you use an approach that consists of four phases: assessment, mobilization, migration, and operation. Before you start a migration, get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase. These details help simplify and automate the entire migration experience.
Engage your AWS Account team or AWS Partner to get the process started or contact an AWS migration specialist.
## Task 2: Document migration goals and impact.
#### Description
Evaluate Migration scope to AWS, VMware licensing impact and timelines
Document the type of applications that you want to migrate. Determine the main concerns that you need to address and the outcomes that you want to achieve by migrating to AWS. Example outcomes are cost savings and increased IT productivity. 

The questions and solutions that you document during the discussion help determine the overall direction for the migration.
