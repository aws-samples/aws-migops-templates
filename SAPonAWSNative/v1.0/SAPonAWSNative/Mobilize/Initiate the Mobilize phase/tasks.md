Throughout an SAP migration, workstream leads make decisions to resolve issues that arise. Because of the size and scope of an SAP migration project, the overall project manager cannot be present when every decision is made. Workstream leads are therefore responsible for recording the decisions that affect their workstream. The project manager is responsible for reviewing and presenting recent decisions at the SteerCo and project status review meetings.

•  Defined decision catalog
## Task 1: Subtask 11: Stand-up the RAID log
#### Description
Similar to the decision log, you should track risks and issues in a project management tool known as a risks, actions, issues, and dependencies (RAID) log. No matter how thoroughly you plan your large migration, issues will occur, and you will identify some risks to your project. By identifying and recording risks and issues, you provide transparency to the project, and you establish a process to control and monitor potential issues, minimizing their impact to the project.
