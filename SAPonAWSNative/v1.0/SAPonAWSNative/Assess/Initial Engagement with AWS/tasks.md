# Module: Initial Engagement with AWS
## Task 1: Get overview of SAP AWS Migration methodology
#### Description
To migrate SAP applications to AWS, we recommend that you use an approach that consists of four phases: assessment, mobilization, migration, and optimization. Before you start a migration, get an overview of these phases and of the AWS tools to consider in each phase. These details help simplify and automate the entire migration experience.
For an overview of the phases and tools that we recommend you use for migrations, see [AWS Migration Hub.](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/).
For an overview of the SAP migration process, see [AWS on SAP Cloud Migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-sap-migration/welcome.html).
