# Module: MAP Program - MRA
## Task 1: Conduct SAP team organizational assessment
#### Description
Organizational aspects are assessed. These include your SAP Center of Excellence and the technical, organizational, and project management capabilities (both in-house and partner-assisted) that would be needed to support migration efforts and to maintain regular operations in parallel with migration. This assessment also includes the operation calendar of the SAP application estate, regular maintenance procedures, backups, and security checks.
## Task 2: Conduct SAP business stakeholder assessment
#### Description
Since SAP impacts many functional business areas, it is important that customers conduct a thorough business stakeholder assessment to verify all organizational and business risks in relation to the SAP migration. 
Stakeholder groups to be assessed should include: Business Process Owners, SAP functional and technical leads, IT & Business Compliance teams, IT & business PMOs, IT Security, and Quality Management/Assurance teams.  
Important business activities to be specifically considered for impacts are: various restricted dates (finance, manufacturing, sales), financial closings, peak trading times, and critical business transaction processing periods (seasonal, etc). 
Input from cross functional business teams should also be considered on critical topics such as business continuity, legal and regulatory compliance, data privacy, data residency, and security.
## Task 3: Review targeted objectives
#### Description
An MRA is a critical step early in the migration journey to assess the readiness of customers' applications for migrating to AWS. Customers gain critical insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the identified gaps.
The MRA also provides AWS and AWS partners with an opportunity to build trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand their adoption into AWS. 
As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives include building an overall vision, creating a reliable implementation roadmap, identifying gaps, and providing corrective actions.
