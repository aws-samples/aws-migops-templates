# Module: Finalizing Migration Waves
## Task 1: Prioritize application migration order and grouping.
#### Description
Application prioritization is the process of determining the order in which applications must be migrated to the cloud. Assess priority based on the complexity of migrating the application to the cloud and the rules that are defined.For more information, see [Large Migration Portfolio playbook prioritization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html.) &  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html#prioritization-2)

After the type of migration strategy is finalized, identify the tools and processes that are appropriate for implementing the strategy.

For more information, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/how-to-migrate/?nc=sn&loc=2.) AWS offers a wide range of tools, resources, and support to help with this process, catering to diverse migration strategies, such as lift-and-shift, re-platforming, and refactoring. This guide is designed to help you choose the right tools and services to do your migration.
## Task 1: Subtask 1: Define the application prioritization process and rules

Perform architecture deepdives as needed.
#### Description
We recommend implementing a factory-like model emulating a production line. Make sure to create waves based on your business , technical and application dependencies requirements in mobilized phase.There are three process options for prioritizing applications:

1) Manual complexity scoring: Use complexity scoring criteria to assess the difficulty of migrating each application
2) Application nomination: Application owners nominate applications for migration
3) Discovery tool: Define criteria within the parameters of the discovery tool, and then the tool analyzes the applications and provides a final complexity score.For more information, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-portfolio-playbook/prioritization.html#prioritization-1)

## Task 2: Subtask 1: Finalize the migration tools best suite for your use case and requirements
#### Description
Begin your migration to the cloud using these AWS native services and tools.  icking the right tools or services for a job. For every use case, you can choose the components or services that are best suited for your specific challenges. Mostly used tools during lift and shift migrations are , AWS Migration Hub (https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub?p=ft&c=mg&z=3) . AWS Application Migration Service(https://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service?p=ft&c=mg&z=3) , Database Migration service (https://aws.amazon.com/dms?p=ft&c=mg&z=3) , VM import/Export (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vm-import/), AWS Backup (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html) , EC2 Image builder (https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) , Amazon FSx (https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/?nc=sn&loc=0) ,AWS Snow device (https://aws.amazon.com/snow/)  , Cloud Migration factory solution (https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/cloud-migration-factory-on-aws/)
